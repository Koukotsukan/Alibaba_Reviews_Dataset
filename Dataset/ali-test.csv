"I ve bought mostly everything for my business from Alibaba. Most of the suppliers I ve dealt with have been great - I ve received what I ordered pretty quickly. Just recently, I had an order go horribly wrong when a supplier took months to even mail out my package, and then it was not what I ordered. I messaged them, and they basically told me to just deal with it and would not make it right. They said if I wanted a refund, I had to pay to ship the items that were not what I ordered back, and the shipping cost was most of what I paid. I was nervous about how Alibaba would handle it. I definitely will continue shopping here after the experience - I was issued a full refund and did not have to pay to ship what I did not order back (thank goodness). Thank you, Alibaba."
"Alibaba offers a huge range of products.
Great portfolios, good prices, but not always with samples available."
Support they have given at each moment is fabulous
The listings are not detailed enough.  There needs to be better listing standards across all items for sale.  I would also like to have estimated shipping costs on every item I view.  Inquiries are either taking too long or no supplier responds to my inquiries.  Sellers should be required to have all the right details.
"This is a great app for finding manufacturers I got my first shipment yesterday and everything is good. Just warning new people, be safe and find a trusted manufacturer."
A great source for those hard to find items!
amazing alibaba  
Be certain you know who you re dealing with a lot of people pretend they are the factory when they are not they use pictures from other suppliers buyer beware
Everything as expected. Great quality of the product and perfect timing of delivery.
"I was able to purchased from the Shantou City Chenghai District Ze Cong Plastic Toys Factory a single sample of a very hard to find (in the USA), BLAZE STORM #7082 Manual Pump Toy Blaster. The product was delivered quickly by DHL Express. The product was packaged safely and arrived undamaged. The quality of the product is actually quite excellent. There was complete transparency by the seller agents. Most co-operative and willing to adjust to customer requirements and needed changes. All cost were within acceptable range. This was a very good purchasing experience from this toy seller. Recommend this seller on Alibaba."
"Rachel Wang from Guangzhou Ruijia Packing Products Co., Ltd very friendly and nice to speak with. Company entertains MOQ of 3000 pieces. Until now, I keep a good memory and experience with them.

On the other hand, bad services received from Huizhou Poleview Commodity Co. Ltd (Ginnie Young) and Shenzhen Anko Industry Co. Ltd (Lego Chen). They both show false prices regarding loofahs. When I confirm minimum price for minimum MOQ in chat boxes, Ginnie Young replied an abrut 'no' and Lego Chen replied an abrut 'no' followed by block his customers. Until now, I can only remember a bad feeling received on that day."
the best the best
Cool
"Great communication, left me feeling comfortable and assured throughout the entire transaction. Product cam early and in exceptional order. Will be purchasing with joe again soon!"
I bought a laptop to check and see if this thing is legit. I m new to all of this. And it was a verified seller. Scammed. Now have a dispute and they don t want to pay me my money. This is ruining the site. And now I m afraid to buy anything else from there. Cruel world. Now the dispute takes forever. Can t get it moving. It s a waiting game. Now it s gonna be a crap show. Now I sent all the info to show it s a scam. But I still think I m gonna get screwed. Because I paid off site. Probably worse they will do is shut the account down.
I received a sample of my peel and stick wall art. It is beautiful. I will be placing an order.
I want sets but it s making me buy individual pieces to build my sets
Paid and waited for more than a month to know that Customs seized goods(nail polish) cause seller s products had Class C drugs in the bottles. Alibaba won t help you with refund. So save your time and money and don t buy from this app. Such a waste.
ZHANG WENDY IS THE MOTIVATOR. HER HONESTY BROUGHT ME FULL TRUST IN THE COMPANY. SHE IS THE BEST EMPLOYEE AND DELIVERED EXACTLY WHAT WAS ORDERED. SHALL KEEP ON BUYING FROM HER. I GIVE HER 5 STAR AND THE COMPANY 5 STAR. ZHANG WENDY I.S A LOYAL AND EFFICIENT EMPLOYEE. THANKS FOR THE GIFTS ALSO=*****
I d give better stars but I can t access my favorites section to review products I hearted in interest of purchasing. Please fix this so I can purchase items and give 5 stars
"I search long and hard for the right company. I am very picky and after a month of searching, I landed on this company for my candle labels and I was not disappointed at all.

I will always use this company for their labels and other things that they sell.

This company sent me my labels faster than I was expecting.

The labels are absolutely stunning and cant wait to hurry up and use them and purchase more.

Tiffany was a dear to work with. She worked with me until we both had it right. She was never mean, rude or standoffish, but sweet, and understanding,

If you pass on this company, you will be making a mistake."
Easy to use
"Alibaba is outstanding in their service delivery .

They have a good quality products with a  fair price."
I got my order before I expected it. I had great communication with the seller. I will order again.
Great place to communicate and get that s custom manufactured by other countries
This app is slow and gets stuck sometimes. I have a better experience on the website.
I did business on this app for over 2 years they get you comfortable with sending your money then start not sending all your orders and then eventually nothing I m still out of 700 dollars
This site has quality merchandise.
I appreciate the balanced concern for both buyers and sellers. I feel very confident in the service.
"Alibaba needs to be shut down, I spent months with my supplier explaining what I needed, sent pictures was very clear from the start. After months of making sure they understood what I wanted to went ahead paid a 50% deposit, the seller dragged me on for 5 months, so they said it would take 5 days, it took 5 months, at first the company rep kept saying it's in production, for 3 weeks, then when i questioned it, they kept sending me 3d renderings, but it never was what I requested. Then when I went to cancel my order, they told me I needed to pay 180 USD for the designs, I explained the designs were always incorrect, So I didnt want to pay the fee. Escalated the case send in my chat history as evidence of things that were agreed upon but never delivered. Alibaba agreed with the seller and took my entire 50% deposit for products I have never even received. This is disturbing and very dishonest"
Nothing to write yet till I receive my order
very helpful along the entire process! Ordering was easy and communication was great! Products were even better than expected!
Alibaba is Great. We trust Alibaba all the way! We shop without a any doubt in our mind. Thanks to Alibaba!
"I love this website only thing is shipment is way to much for me do I don t buy that much, I have trilby paying for it I wanted candles and they wanted 40 bucks to ship a couple of candles"
I was wondering do you have a credit deal we re I could get the product on payments . Thank you
I hear this is a awesome company looking forward to doing business with you
But when I heart things and I go back to look for them to buy the item not all of my items show so I can never find it
"I really have tried but have not felt comfortable with the way communication between seller an buyer is constructed. It is too open ended... too many products too broad in scope. 
If I type in Teak flooring, i get responses from manufacturers of thousands of different product remotely related to teak flooring including laminate flooring, vinyl flooring , plastic flooring.... 
It s all confusing... and throw in the language, time, distance differences... I am afraid to commit to what would be tens of thousands of dollars to such a confusing gamble."
I love this app. It helped me start my own business
"Nice
easy
safe
thank you"
Awesome. love it
"After using the search function, I cannot find my way back to HOME."
The Company delivered earlier than expected. the product is of great Quality and the Correspondence all throughout was amazing
"They should add in the description that you may never get the products or it may take more than two months.
App looks good but fails to deliver."
"The amount of different products is exceptional.  If all goes well, I will add a further review.  Sue B. 2021"
i had nice experience with my last purchase..everything went smooth.
Extremely difficult to use
Awesome! This product was amazing.
This app alone has shown me the ability to become my own employer
"the worst of the worst in products and quality.  unfortunately I had to experiment in a couple of purchases and foolishly I expected that my second purchase would be better and nothing.  money and time wasted.  I do not recommend this application at all, much less the products  "
Please never buy in this app I paid 1020 dollars for two PS5 I never received the PS5 the seller kept my money and he never answered my messages.  this is a scam do not buy in this application they change their company name and phone numbers.  I already lost my money but you don t do the same don t buy on alibaba
Great product and on time delivery. Satisfied
"Bought lipsticks, and the first batch was good.    Then bought 100 of lipsticks from same person and I didn t investigate because first ones were fine.   Well the second order was messed up.   The lipsticks were not the correct colors.    Contacted the seller.  Still had the window to return but they were closed for Chinese New Year.   Said she would get back with me In a couple of weeks.   Well window closed for me to report.     She then said nothing she could do."
"Please fix the bugs. Not able to type into the search bar, and not able to add files in messenger. Was a 5 star app before changes occurred"
"The Alibaba app does not link automatically to my Alibaba account that I access from my PC. Other apps have this function. I can t find any instructions on this app on how to access my existing account from the app. Also, the app has bugs - shows I have three items in my cart but I never put anything in my cart. When I click on my cart, it is empty but still the number 3 will not go away."
told them what i wanted and they quoted it at a great price. very easy to work with.
"I tried placing order for 1000 pieces. Though they require me to pay in cash app not in alibaba. 
I complaint  about them in alibaba customers service. They didn't take any action as well!!!!!!!"
Easy to find products and manufacturers. FOllow up is very useful and all the tools available to connect and exchange requirements and points of view.
Very good price with good quality. Fast service
I have had many orders in Alibaba and till now i am happy with their service.
Perfect  
"Very Very very very very very very very very bad company please don t use this company I already lost a lot of money because of this.
This supplier Lie to me and still my money.
Guangzhou penbo display products co
No. 1805 building b Zhongzhou middle pazhou

"Need more transparent info on customer options for International Shipping options especially for US customers since we put preference on speed of delivery with associated costs over free shipping. Please add a feature in the app that does exactly that.  Please also allow customers the option to choose Intl shipping during the ordering process and update the cost of the product + shipping and getting total cost reflect that. 

Also on every phase of the order once a product is paid, the magnitude of efficient customer support should be enabled between buyer and seller to ensure buyer is not left in the dark making them think alibaba or seller simply walked away with buyer s money."
I love the app but ever since I did the update I can't even open the app and it is extremely frustrating  
"quite good, nice"
We use this application most of the time for business or personal needs.
Wish it will do well..
It is my first time with Alibaba and it has been a good experience.
Thanks so such you guys really came through for me I must say I love really nice branding
Good Product best service
I wanted to send an image to the supplier to show exactly what I need but when I click on attachment it does not show all my photos and I was unable to show them what I need
I found it difficult to figure out how to use this site. It didn t seem very user friendly. Perhaps in time it will become easier for me to find what I want and understand how the process works.
"Reactivate my account!!!I can t access the quotations. Shame on you Alibaba, AliExpress never gives me problem. My account was deactivated, and I couldn t access all my goods to be ordered, I am scared I might lose my money if I ordered from this poor customer service platform."
Order by one finger
I am really happy
"Although this app has many good looking or feeling item many of the people who are listing items through the app don t communicate well, they don t have a customer support Ai, and refunding items takes extremely long times. Shipping also takes a extra long time"
It s difficult to request parts without talking to someone and only using email. I want to send pictures of what I need so there won t be any mistakes.
The product and the attention are very good and professional. shipping was on time. I highly recommend it
Amazing experience!!! Great product!!! Excellent service!!!
"Trade assurance failed to hold seller accountable to multiple documented failures. 
Representatives used my due dates against me the first time by constantly asking for the same info repeatedly. Once you miss one response due date they close the case despite all the documentation the seller failed to provide what was advertised. 
I had time to play this game twice with Trade assurance but the outcome was the same."
Brilliant app  
It s my first time purchasing items. I m still very confused on how to exactly go about doing so.
I wanted to reach out to vendors but I can t do so without signing in. I ve created two accounts and I cannot sign into either of them. I can t even submit a support request.
"What a wonderful friendly user app.. best way to contact manufacturers in China..
Great work"
Nice nicer  
"They (the manufacturer) were very patient and responded to all inquiries and concerns throughout the process. Shipping was fast and well-packaged. Value was significant. The platform to connect, communicate, and transact worked very well."
"i am a first time buyer and i would like to try and look the quality and i found that its hard for me to find shoes that many people in my country sell comes from china. hard to find. hope you can do something for a beginner like me, really appreciate it."
"Well organized, Great Service and an Easy way to find quality manufacturers and products. Will continue to use for future orders."
Very helpful with all questions and will work with on quanity.
Very good shopping site
"I really like the app, you have everything in your hand!"
When I was talking with April Lau she made me feel like she wanted my business. I did not feel pressured to make a payment right away. She was up front and honest with my airbag design and looked into it to see if the company could make it like I had asked. When I asked for a bunch of pics I was given pics of the airbag when it was finished.
I have had a great experience on Ali-Baba. I made my first purchase and was happy when I received my product as advertised. I will be doing more business with Ali-Baba. Thank you for this awesome platform.  
I made a purchase from here on the 16th of August and today is the 13th of October and I still haven t received ANYTHING!!! And there isn t even a way within a number anywhere that I can talk I have No good to say
"A little bit of research and you will discover that many of the sellers at one of the major Internet vendors websites why really simply having products drop shipped from China through relationships with Alibaba. You can do it yourself, if you have the guts. Don t even think about sending anything back. They are shipping to you for free but if you try to ship it back shipping will cost about as much as the item cost if not more. Bon chance."
Veru nice application  
"I ordered 55 pens an only received 29 I ve reached out to the supplier several times for an update or resolution for the problem since then pens that was sent wasn t the correct color I ordered
Ordered 10 black pen-received 5, 8 purple got 5, 8 white got 0, 8 pink got 0, 2 royal blue got 0 just ridiculous"
"I bought a pair of shoes which I never received. It was a scam supplier and when I started the refund process, first, they are in China and they barely understand what you say. Second,Their return process will drive you crazy. After trying for 1 hour, I wasn t able to apply for the refund because they made it impossible for the individual customer who buy a single product. You would need to provide a lot of details which is practicaly impossible for a person without a CPA. 
It was a bad experience and please don t think they are American platforms who are providing customer service or that easy.
Let s not waste American dollars here, for God sake. Please support your own business.
Thanks"
I started looking into your site about 10 years ago.  Your search engine has improved tremendously.  You can find what you are looking for with much easement.  I would like to pay through Pay Pal which is my payment choice. Also things change like the different kinds of embroidery threads.  I am looking for Twisted embroidery thread.  It is very different from variegated thread. The twisted thread is made from two strings of different colors.  The variegated thread is only one string dyed with different colors.  Your site does not seem to know the difference.  Thanks. Vilma Anderson
I love it
Very unprofessional and rude vendors on this app.
I love this app for purchasing items for my boyfriends bike shop and for my jewelry business. Products are quality at good prices...the apps well organized
Best sourcing platform
"I bought merchandise from one of the vendors which still I have not received they kept changing  the date I opened a dispute since I was getting no where the vendor send me a message saying if I didn t change my dispute he would not refund me I escalated the issue still no refund I m very disappointed and I believe could have been handled differently my dispute is still open , I have my own business and I m work with other business I will be letting them know about my experience . I upload pictures of the messages from the vendor to the dispute department ."
Wow
Everything satisfied
Your apps is complicated to use. There s no option to choose the quantity we wish to buy neither the option for the price nor the option buy. I get lost with this apps. I can t use it. I m out. Sorry.
"Very easy to use. Alibaba makes ordering easy. The only suggestion I have is be aware of brokerage fee's from other delivery companies. Not Alibaba's fault. You are at risk of overpaying on delivery fee's for ""illegitimate"" charges. Duty and taxes are one thing but to pay $30 on brokerage fees for a $120 order is RIDICULOUS!"
"This company will steal your money!! I never received my orders and when I tried to dispute, Alibaba refused to issue refund and refused to contact the seller to try and issue a refund. If I could give this company zero stars I would!"
the purchase of your items have insurance against fraud
Is reliable
This app is easy to navigate through and real time responses. I  it!
The app so far has been easy to use but it isn t optimized for my screen that well. Everything s too big and I have to scroll more to see similar items. The screen optimization could be way better.
"Shandong Jieriu Machinery & Equipment: Alibaba,
The Sawmill I recently purchased is surprisingly a great quality saw. The gauge metal used was thicker than I expected.... the shipping was on time as promised, and I will return to purchase another unit (or three) sooner than later! Thanks Jerry @ Shandong Jieriu Machinery & Equipment!
William - USA"
"I enjoyed the communication. English is not great but is workable. The shipping and professionalism when dealing with quoting and such was excellent!

I dislike the advertising as what I received was not what was advertised. The quality of scanners and insides should have been shown and or mentioned. Though the product is definitely bright and will work, price is still great. I am satisfied for what I paid. But advertiser should do a better job with showing their actual product and not something else!"
Customer service from Victor & his team @ Jinyu Sporting company. Expert guidance & provided a range of choices/options for personalising specifications of an ebike. Very smooth transaction too!
I just inquired about a product from a manufacturer in China and they somehow turned it into an ORDER for $ 7500. Beware there s a big gap in communication and sometimes ethics.
I made a order waited 30 days for them to ask for more money two more time and still have not received my order. I contacted seller for a refund and he said no pay$1500 more money. It s been 90 days now. They stole total of $2840 so do not buy from these people. I file a dispute and still heard nothing. Scam!!!!!!!!!!
You keep getting between me and my need to transact another business so I disconnected this ap and you are still here preventing me from the opportunity to get a vehicle. Please go away
Why did u block my payment option
"I have tried for years now to purchase something even emails etc never get a response i have given up on this app and I m not the only as I can see not even my friends have been able to purchase anything so to me this app is a scam to get information . I get upset just by seeing show up on Facebook ,marketplace,App Store etc"
Very disappointing. Very on responsive to requests
I can get a toy called Mecard for only 11$ per one. Better than 15 $ online!
"Everything was great from start to finish. Service is amazing, i was extremely happy with the products i received."
They delivered something I've been wanting for a very long time at a very fair price and with great customer service.
I ordered stuff three years have not gotten anything I ordered. You are a rip off. I ordered about eight things for Christmas in 2020 and still NOTHING!
White screen when i opened any item
I ordered a replacement digitiser for my sons phone. It cost me  69 but I was under the impression it was a new part. When it came it was packaged really well and no way could've been damaged in transit. I fitted the new part easy enough I do this sort of thing for a job but broke the glass back by accident which I also had to replace. When I powered it up it had green pixelations in the centre of the screen which I reported to Alibaba. They agreed at first to refund me if I returned the part. I explained to do that I'd have to remove the adhesive and the glass back again which could end ip with me breaking it at more cost to me. They said they'd refund me $10 then $20 for my inconvenience. I asked again for a better offer than that for all the hassle then they stopped offering and closed the dispute. They said the part is second hand and therefor perfectly fine to sell in that state. I was not aware I was buying a second hand part! Let alone a faulty one! I've appealed their decision but as yet not heard from them. I wouldn't ever order from them again and advise anyone who is thinking of ordering from them to look for another supplier.  
Very good app
"Alibaba is an exceptional platform for anyone looking to grow their business. I love the wide variety of product options available and the user-friendly website. Additionally, I feel very secure doing business through Alibaba, as the platform offers security and protection measures to ensure safe and reliable transactions. Overall, I highly recommend Alibaba as an agile, secure, and product-rich platform for anyone looking to expand their business"
Can t even type. There is a 10 second delay after I send a message where the app freezes. I am using iPhone X
Not getting a lot of feedback and not user friendly kinda difficult to get to wholesalers
Easy to source what you need no problems at all
Those so far the communication has been great.
"The customer service from Amanda was excellent and the parts produced from the mold were perfect - all for a price that was among the lowest quotes we received.
All around, an excellent experience."
Gobricks is highest quality bricks supplier. Very professional
"You are crazy, your company made it impossible to buy anything from you, absolutely unnecessary filling out the forms that you require, and I am no longer going to buy anything from you, and I will inform my friends."
"I don t understand how shipping is so pricey, I order clothes and I m being told shipping is 50 to may 70 dollars. Deal with dh gate or another site. Makes no sense to me. I better get the items I ordered I have a feeling I won t through.
I have had a couple sellers try and up the shipping prices. They don t like to sell one piece they want you to buy a lot. They are hard to deal with I m about done using this app"
It s hard for us based buyers to see specs and understand what the product does. And what is cost of shipment.
The vendors will upload a price to grab your attention but want you to text them on Whatapp to give you a different price that s false advertisement and when I speak to them and let them know they all will say everyone else is doing it and they don t get shut down for it. Every app have a disclosure I m not understanding how they break it but still get to promote on the app.
"Accurate, quality site. Most of the wholesalers respond quickly and with detailed information. I like it a lot"
"Can u sent me a sample or i pay one unit include delivery charges..please sent me a detail.if i satisfies the product and I promise  to more than 1000 unit,tq"
"To whom it may concern,
Love your price s but can t get any answers to be able to buy."
Great products fast shipping easy to use thanks
VERY NICE TO TALK DIRECT WITH MANUFACTOR AND GET PRODUCTS DELIVERED TO MY DOOR
Ridiculous shipping charges on smaller orders. There are better shopping sites available with cheaper shipping. Avoid this app.
"Very good and fast response!
Thank you very much."
"It was my initial review:
 Just downloaded the app and registered with all my personal information verifying via email and phone number. Then suddenly system log me out and when I try to log in it keeps saying  abnormal account . I and my business are both very normal; but seems your system with your app are very abnormal. Fix it or ditch it. 

But since then nothing changed besides back and forth emails after developers response. For my requests and questions to restore my account alibaba replies with more unrelated questions to solve the problem from their side like what phone company I use etc trying to collect more personal data which is actually none of their business. 

Now imagine if you invest large amount of money in some manufacturing company in China and issue arises from their side alibaba is totally useless to solve such issues. Sadly it [Ali Baba] was the name of one of my favorite fairytale heroes of my childhood, but Chinese stall it and corrupted."
"Communication and understanding was very easy at all steps in process. Service was knowledgeable and friendly. Company adapted with ease to product design specifics. From date of order it was shipment ready within 10 days. Further, based on experience with the product over the past 3 weeks, it performs as expected. Shipping as managed by the manufacturer was great. For instance, within 4 days product arrived in a city near me and was though customs. Meanwhile UPS on my end was slow to the mark and added a further 4 days. Overall very satisfied."
No communication available by phone or messages no one ever respond with being assist you outta any difficulty
The best
Mind boggling  
very help full
Nice App and easier shipment to your preferred country
More for resale than for personal shopping but cheap prices
Recommend
Text is the wrong size (way too big) and certain buttons just don t register.
"fast shipping
good service"
I like the app but there s a bit of a learning curve.
Wonderful selections of a lot of products!!
They only accept wire transfers and western union transfers for American citizens now  I ve been a customer for YEARS. Now all of a sudden I can t pusrchase a order with my debit card. It s disappointing that I have to find another wholesaler.
"ALIBABA ARE TERRIBLE. LOVE BEYOND ARE TERRIBLE. AVOID BUYING. THE ALIBABA SITE HAVE RULES & REGULATIONS TO SUPPOSEDLY PROTECT THE BUYER BUT THEY ALLOW THE SELLERS TO CON PEOPLE. ORDERED UNDERWEAR WHICH WAS DISPATCHED EXTREMELY LATE EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD A DISPATCH GUARANTEE DATE BUT ALIBABA ALLOWED THIS. ORDERED JANUARY 23 RECEIVED IN LATE APRIL 23 , DISGUSTING FOR A TINY ORDER OF 25 PAIRS OF BOXER SHORTS. THE SELLER ""LOVE BEYOND"" LIED ABOUT DISPATCH, LIED ABOUT TRACKING NUMBERS & AVOIDED RESOLVING THE ISSUES THEY THEMSELVES CREATED. TAKING MY MONEY WAS AN EASY TRANSACTION THOUGH!! ALIBABA CUSTOMER SERVICE WERE GIVEN ALL PROOF OF THIS TERRIBLE BUSINESS BUT DID NOT HELP THE BUYER. SHAME ON THE ALIBABA & LOVE BEYOND!!!"
After ordering on this website I ve gotten an immediate explosion of fraud scammer texts. The few bucks I saved if the stuff shoes up correct won t have been worth it having my phone going off all day with fake account notices
Good service
"I use an ipad and this app has too many glitches to think of right now but my main gripe is a recent change in the search results to only display one third of the image of the product you are searching for. Completely moronic!  Then when you try to swipe down to go back up the list of results it totally closes the search window so you must start over.   On the home screen, most of the time when you click on a product link you wind up frozen on a blank screen.   When you click on promoted items, you wind up randomly somewhere other than the promoted listing page you clicked on.  Come one people, for such a huge and rich company, you have an app that was built by an amature!  It really is dissapointing!"
"This app is very good

And user friendly

Thanks"
Great thanks  
the staff very helpful and good respond also the product is good quality
"the amethyst geodes I bought was as described & was good quality and ideal sizes

it's very difficult to buy rough stones online. The fact that this supplier is willing & even offered to work with me to resolve (a different) issue gives me confidence to work with them again . Very professional service"
Good app n convenient.
I ve never had any problems with this app. It is great for when you have to step away from the computer. Easy to use.
"Keep getting countless unwanted Promotion
messages which even with notifications turned off still create a red indication on the app which FORCES YOU to open and clear each individual unwanted promotional message. So annoying!!!!!! THERE NEEDS TO NE A WAY TO DISABLE RECEIVING PROMOTIONS, IT S SPAM!!!!!!"
"Don t waste your money buying on this app, the app and people selling on the app they all scammers, they will take your money and you will never see the items you purchase..
Walk away from this app.."
Easy to find required items. Problem is only with credit card payment.
"There are hundreds of products, but they all post one price , most have a MSQ listed at XYZ price. Then when a quote is requested the price increases by 400% . The manufacturers expect you to buy a million pieces to give the price originally listed. 
ThTs without the freight fees and no one seems to understand English.  Either that or they just have an auto reply system stating the same over and over. 
It s the worst and most frustrating experience for people who want to do business."
"Very power full mam power,custermer servis very fast respon"
"The site is reassuring. I was a little worried about buying internationally but the Alibaba website makes it super simple and I feel good about the customer rating system. 

Stay tuned for more updates as I make my purchases and I will let you know how it goes! 

So far it s a 2 thumbs up.  

Mr. New_To_Alibaba in the US!"
"I have had excellent communication, sales, and transportation arrangements with this system. Not all sellers are the same and due diligence is necessary as in any online transaction. I have been very satisfied."
I can t use on the go! It always says  no network  when I m not home and tied into my Personal WiFi! Like even at work...therefore unusable and useless.
Zhicheng did a very good job! Thanks for that and now i am looking forward to make bigger orders with Zhicheng
I m not sure why but every time I try to log into the app it s saying that I can t. I ve verified my account and email and have logged in before but now I can t even though I have updated the app. What is the issue?
"Everything is super zoomed in on iPad, there is no landscape mode?? And half the time stuff doesn t load. Also when I try to use the website it forces me to use the app so now I have to uninstall it. Please fix."
Would be 5 stars but not always receiving important notifications. Not good business.
"Very simple. First they said I did not provide an address. Then they said the address provided did not have a 9 digit zip. Then (even though they admitted I had not received the product), they cancelled the refund request. This seller is a scammer. Do NOT do business with them. Still fighting with my credit card company for a refund."
"After a little learning curve, this app is helpful."
I picked it so it can show me electronics and it shows me s3x toy and how to grow if you know you know it very no no
Fast Delivery and nice product
Good app lot of items good items
I wish to say that there is widespread misrepresentation by vendors on Alibaba. What is posted on the page of the vendors is not available. One cannot judge what is actually available or the price that one will be quoted later from what is posted on the webpage of the vendors. This practice would not be tolerated in the United States. It reflects very badly on the vendors. Alibaba needs to begin an investigation into what is referred to in the West as  bait and switch  or its reputation as a business-to-business platform will be severely harmed.
"First purchase on Alibaba, and very well, good application and good provider"
When purchasing with these suppliers MAKE SURE 1.) They are verified!!!! 2.) THEY ARE PROFESSIONAL! I was supposed receive a package and didn t. I reached out to the supplier and they were barely cooperating with UPS for me to get my refund which is a 1-2 week process just to give the supplier their refund then give to me. I will never use that supplier again but the app itself is ok
"I have to admit,it is always a learning experience and fun to see all the new ideas,,advanced and rends,also the interactive shopping experience every time I use any service on this site or the app..thankyou for making this possible  "
Very smooth transaction.
"I will never use this app again they don t solve any issues that you may have , they ask for evidence but don t really care"
Quick delivery& Good product.
Great customer support item was sent back and I was told the replacement is on the way that fast. Wow
You guys are great you have everything I want
Great need more info on some cars just not sure about small Buisness
"Suppliers does not ship after I paid for stuff for half a month, one of them even try to lure me using payment method outside of platform. Refund costs transaction fee. Buyers  right is not protected. Also, the app is very buggy. Stay away!"
The supplier was great to deal with. I was made so comfortable during the whole process altogether. Highly recommend Alibaba.com for future business.
"The app has many issues, one being a horrible chat feature. The app seems really outdated"
Love it but it can be very tricky navigating through alibaba unless you re on every day for weeks!
I ordered goods through Alibaba which was handled very proficiently. Alibaba performance is above board.
"Prices displayed are not true prices, and products don t arrive when you order them"
App doesn t seem to want to connect going to the website is easier to get updates
I m just getting started but so far it has been pleasant 
"the best seller of work shoes I am seriously always willing to meet and help solve certain issues
quickly and efficiently"
"I bought something from China, didn t get the correct item so I gave that company a 1 star review. Now they re calling me directly from China and leaving voicemails. I don t appreciate my phone number being given out. Don t buy anything from here"
Ive been ripped off on alibaba and they won t even answer my texts at hbei chemicals. I will make sure people here in usa stay away from alibaba that s for sure.
"Never seen such a large company produce such garbage. Considering how much money this company has, it s such an embarrassment. Appears they purposefully chose the most inadequate and most inept programmers in the world to write this over a weekend instead of hiring  real programmers to create a usable app. This app is so full of bugs that it s barely useful. Every time they release an yo spate, it s worst then the last. Instead of fixing bugs, they introduce dozens more every time."
"Just had to deal with a very rude supplier and during chat w/customer service about the situation they apologized which I appreciated of course-only until later when Alibaba e-mailed me that they couldn t see anything wrong in the supplier s behavior-HUH?! Customer service literally apologized a few minutes ago.
Pick a side lol.
Plus, any company who s fine that suppliers treat them horrible needs to check their values again "
Great app
I didnt receive any respond from the main manufacturer
Aliababa trade assurance is absolute bs and will push in favor of their chinese sellers to the point of absolute screwing the buyer. ONLY use this app for contacting suppliers then transact on safer platforms like paypal etc. Alibaba doesnt go based on evidence in case of claims such as what happened to me. Still non delivered 90 days later they just push timeline and say it could happen when its simple not true and there was no proof of pickup etc. HORRIBLE customer service if it get rough.
Your variety of products are always good quality also is very good and prices are very good
This is a very good app and it s very useful
This app is way too confusing. Why can t you simply order a jersey instead of sending inquiry. I will stick with DHgate.
"Even though they provide an option to turn off promotion notifications, this has no effect. I am constantly receiving 3-5 unneeded push notifications per day"
So far so good. Downloaded and installed perfectly with safari. App is functional and user friendly. Will give five stars after first purchase.
Some factory say in the ad that they have alibaba express shipping but when you contact them did not have it.
Everyone seems to use everyone else photos as if they done the work. very hard to figure out who is telling the truth. Alibaba needs to crack down on this and make sure suppliers are not using someone else s photos. Not everyone is as smart or know the apparel industry to know what s the truth and what s a lie when it comes to shipping and fabric. Don t be so quick to send payment without doing research on the company you are working with.
"Poor details of sizes of products with no reviews.  I don t know if I want to trust this place.  Do thy homework.  If I get great results, I ll change my review."
"We bought a Yag laser tattoo remover machine through Alibaba, which was damaged and non-functional. Apparently the supplier dumped on us a returned machine. Both the supplier and Alibaba customers service was very bad. Both were not only rude but were very respectful. Particularly Alibaba customers service lady had no manners, rude, disrespectful. I will be starting a complaint process here in the US. Will not buy again through Alibaba, the ultimate cheats."
"Once you get registered, the app works well, just be prepared to wait a day or two for the confirmation email. I get very fast responses to inquiries."
"Lack of currencies in your listing.
And do avoid spam from your listed companies."
I can t get see my messages on the app. They only appear on my computer.
Good app 
perfect for my online business.
Don t send money through WesternUnion no matter what unless you been there and met them don t send them money through WesternUnion. Ues alibaba pay withe credit card. There are so many scammers. Only do businesse withe people who are 10 years or up members.
I m really liking this but I m not sure how it works. I m anxious to order a knife so I understand better how it works.
"I bought 120 Oil Diffuser pods  380 including pods shipping and import duty.
took a few out at random, they're rechargeable but these only work when they're actually charging. the company I purchased the items from had already deleted our conversations and I hadn't made a note of the company name so I took all day to find something that got me in touch with the company but only a review where I told them what I thought. I've reported them to Alibaba but I'm not holding my breath."
This app restricts you from buying things that are 18+ and there website format when scrolling is trash. Example- Whenever you look at an item on page 6 and you want to go back where you were it sends you all the way back to page 1 and you have to manually scroll all the way back where you were. It s very irritating. If I could give this app a half star I would.
"So far so good this App from registration and getting in touch with the right Contact/Supplier without diverting to other misleading websites or products.
In short, ease and friendly to use."
Since last week  I can t use the photo search to search products on this app very disappointed
China has the best quality looms in the world bar none.
Would like to order.....: need help please contact me . Thanks
"I found exactly what I was looking for ,but your app will not let me add it to my favorites ,verify my email address so I can speak with vendors, and it also will not let me update any of my account information it just keeps saying error ."
Great communication + professional service + fast delivery = quality product on time.
This site is for the person that wants the best but can not afford it
"I am satisfied with the service, response and delivery leading up to the order. However, there was a mistake in the quality of a very small number of products, so I will give it ""4 stars"".The other quality is completely fine, so I am looking forward to the next time."
Products that fit our need at the right price.
"My Purchase arrive on time, fast and accurately."
"Misleading advertising.
Don't waste your time with the free 30-day trial.
The trial invites you to post an advert for your product.
You can only write it. And if you don't buy the service for more than $3000, you'll have spent hours preparing your ad for nothing.
If it's not possible to put a product online, what's the point of a 30-day test? Absolutely nothing.
Alibaba informs us that this test allows us to see how an ad is written. What's more, they continue to take you for a fool!
To see how an ad is written, all you have to do is visit the Alibaba website !!!
Liar and manipulator.
It's supposedly saved but it's not. You'll have to start all over again.
It's a shame to lie and take people for fools.
If Alibaba can only sell these services by lying, how can you trust them?"
"I don t understand if having Trade Assurance is necessary and why?   Is it like an insurance policy?   Does it accelerate the shipping process? 
Thank You 
Russ"
Love this app just wished they showed all the reviews instead of a few
Nice for purchase an sale
I got many experience working with Chinese companies. More Shenzen company. Respect their work!
Ordered many different items. Some were shipped to the wrong address & no refund given. Other items were damaged & no refund given. So disappointed. Save your money and stress don t use this app & buy anything from here.
Great supplier great services. Nice buying experience!
Wonderful
"good bravo , I like"
"I'm new to this provider but I have Heard great things! So I'm curious to see what they offer? 

           Update on the performance and general operation of Alibaba sites.   
     
      It s a great site and great products. but I m probably over thinking of how to operate some of the features that coincide on or with site to store operation?"
Good ap
"IM A BLACK WOMAN and i purchased a SKIN BLEACHING lotion with the alibaba seller matsuicardenbeauty.com. I now look far more light skin like im biracial my skin is beautiful and exotic because of this matsui companies stronger "" professional ""strength skin bleaching products. Thank you alibaba for your great third party seller matsuicardenbeauty.com i could not be happier."
Excellent
" Seller lists item for a reasonable price; 
 Customer buys and pays for item;
 The price  recently  changed - it s now (10x or 20x the listing price) 
 Now you re stuck in a refund, and have to wait for seller to approve it - your money is now hostage;
From 9 orders I ve placed, only 3 came through - all others were cancelled. There ARE honest sellers in the platform, but the sneaky ones are hard to spot.
While Alibaba don t ban and force check against these behaviors, they deserve 1 star  "
"I was promoted to download the app on my iPhone 6, so I did. Has a questionnaire at first. Asked what type of seller or buyer I am, then category boxes asking me to select at least one. So I selected 3 categories but then NOTHING! No way to proceed. 
Deleted app."
"I hate the way the app is. Very stressful and difficult to understand! Cluttered, too over saturated with suppliers and products, i hate using it. And their refund assurance is garbage. It s contingent upon the seller saying it was paid. They leave it in pending status so that you NEVER GET A REFUND!!"
Easy to work with and great product. Answered all questions in a timely manner - according to time zone differences. Would would with again.
"I love the app. My vendors are amazing! My only issue is, are the videos that are posted in customers reviews on the app. They don t play and I don t know why. It would help me, personally, if their videos would play in the reviews. That s my only problem."
I like it very much. So many products and very inexpensive.
Y r u not sending me that size 9 white shoe
Really easy to work and learned fast!
"easy and quick communication, very fast shipment."
Difficult to navigate. Can t get back to search window 
i love it i order more Anime girl figures from Alibaba.com thank you
This app allows its sellers to steal from you and lie to you and never deliver product that you ve paid $1000s of money for!!!!  They pretend to investigate and they investigate absolutely NOTHING!!! There s no phone number and no email for trade assurance! It s an imaginary person that pretends to care and NEVER justifies any decisions! This whole app is a scam!! Run fast! These people are fraudsters!
"Found product we needed, exactly as advertised. Very good overall experience."
I would like to check-out some products but the download cannot be completed.
Alibaba makes it so easy to shop and get in touch with prospective sellers and buyers! Wonderful!
"The app and desktop versions do not correlate. When I put items in my cart on the desktop, they are not there on the app. The same with messages. My messages on the desktop do not show up in the app. It s very inconvenient because I cannot always use the app."
I have worked with a few different companies and have only had one company that was not communicative. I have found Ali Baba is a great resource for my retail shop. I will continue to use them as their service is very good and I feel I can trust them.
best apps you cauld buy..everything you want
"Alibaba does not allowing me to leave a review on a seller, who is selling poor quality machines. Jinning Saao Machinery is the company who makes them!"
"Awesomeness!!! Love, love, love, it!!!"
The app is really great but sometimes a bit glitchy and hangs. I love how easy hey have made it connect with thousands of suppliers fast
I think it can be very empowering to many people.
"First and last time I will use alibaba. Items got lost in transit. I have only received a partial refund. Alibaba refuse to refund the balance, even though I haven't received anything. Shocking service."
"Good day everyone. I had ban experience. Decided to buy TV Samsung, good price, cheap price! Used chat online at Alibaba, manager of Xiamen Duyu Trading Co., Ltd ask watsapp number, I gave. During 10 min, from +905310152350 i received an invoice and request to pay not to company but to a physical person Sergei Scaun at Bank of Georgia, amount 465 eur. After it I received a track number, which can be checked at transitgatxpresslogistics.co, this tracking number not related to DHL, UPS and other world wide logistic companies (fake tracking number and web resource). On the next day I received message from manager, that I have to pay an insurance 1201 eur, which is returnable, of course with Invoice and again to pay to physical person Mariam Beridze at Bank of Georgia. Of course at question, details of insurance company I did not get a clear answer. From my side I inform Alibaba about violators. As well offer to Alibaba personal and professional assistance because this company Xiamen Duyu Trading Co., Ltd not only one. Another one AK ESSENTIALS LIMITED link, officially dissolved at 22 September 2015 according to Company House information. Unfortunately impossible to set a reviews at Alibaba about this companies. No one knows where goes this criminal money to support international terrorism or criminal activity. Please be careful before paying."
The supplier we use is exceptionally good. Their ability to communicate clearly and stick to promised delivery dates is superb. Always best to go via Alibaba for peace of mind.
Work super well. Congrats.
"I like the app to find products but it is bad to communicate with sellers. I just chatted with a seller, closes the app, opened it again and the chat I just did does not show up anymore, just older chats. That happens all the time, please fix!"
Great app and company. I have been registered with alibabba for several years now. Thank you
Thanks
Awesome
"Although I am still a new member, this app is intelligently designed"
You guys are awesome keep up the good work.
Learning to navigate the website is a bit confusing
"I like and want to order several items on here. However after initial brief contact of basically  hello , I hear nothing back from the seller after submitting my information (address, phone number etc). This leaves me questioning what they are doing with my information provided- because they aren t sending invoices or feedback to my questions. Until this improves I am rating at a 1 Star-though 0 stars wasn t an option."
Absolutely good and easy to use
ALL PERFECT !!! THANK YOU
"I'm new to alibaba, but so far this site is so much easier to navigate than I expected. I'm looking forward to actually making investments using alibaba."
I ve been struggling for 5 months now the merchant says my stuff are at customs I no longer want the product and Alibaba aren t helping me out worst experience I ve had my money has be stranded for months now and I still haven t gotten my product make sure you are willing to put your money on hold for a while before you buy anything.
"Although it takes a little time to get your order, the process was easy, well controlled and the cost for the items was good."
"The product supplier ""Icey Huang, Sales Manager "" helped me lot to describe the working of the vibration plate with video, provide the cost of all relevant products including the transportation cost. I have fulfilled with this working of this product."
"It was easy to make the order and fast, witch is very good. The price of the product was also good. The only point that i was not stisfied with is the shipping rate. Way over priced. All the rest was perfect."
Don't buy from Alibaba is AS THEY ARE REAL SCAMMERS. Bought from them online received an Damage item and they refuse to refund or exchange the Damage items Fraudsters
Great respons and fast delivery by flight - good to reply and understand English.
I am unable to delete my credit card information.  Difficult to find the bank information.
Excellent. Easy to use and very convenient.
Just downloaded the app but I can t login because it does not offer gmail login like it goes online. Very disappointed. How do you expect people to login using Google account?
"It is a nice product, good quality and also the Price is good"
"Everything is good nice people.
But, it depends on the company, they are required different alibaba fees.There are no standard rules about fee. this is sort of inconvenience.

But the other this are so far so good."
Most confusing platform on the internet. You d have better luck finding what you are after by peeling an onion.
I m having trouble seeing if this is fake or will I really get my product it looks sketchy someone confirm and send pics if u can pls
"Be extremely cautious with using this site and especially the seller or supplier that you work with. Make sure to look at the reviews. If you are in the US look for reviews from others in the US.

After doing some research on the dispute process on Alibaba.com through the trade assurance, it can be a pretty complicated process to order from suppliers outside of the US. You must be very specific in your specifications of both the merchandise, shipment, quality guarantees and time lines.

You must also make sure to not surrender carrier liability and request that shipment be made when you are at home to receive it. You must also make sure that the external and internal shipping materials are not damaged in any way. If they are take a picture and possibly even refuse the delivery. If there is anything wrong with your merchandise you need to contact the seller or supplier ASAP and begin The refund application. They will likely attempt to tell you that it is damage that occurred through shipping and therefore you will have to create a claim with the carrier. That s why it s very important that if you re using UPS or FedEx that you require the shipment in hand and do not surrender carrier liability by authorizing them to leave it at your door.

The seller or supplier will encourage you to cancel your dispute. Never do that. You will have to make the effort to be extremely thorough in your refund application and provide plenty of evidence.

I m in a dispute process right now and I went in pretty hard on the cellar and threw everything at them and let them know that I believe the seller to be malicious in his dealings with me. This is not like returning something from amazon.com. Please keep that in mind when thinking about using Alibaba.com. I do not recommend buying from seller OUS on that site."
"Search for anything and you can expect to be tracked and spammed to death for it. App is ok, Alibaba is annoying and over the top obnoxious like that crazy uncle who can t have a conversation without selling you on his latest MLM opportunity. Ugh!"
I don t really like the app. Very confusing.
"When i downloaded this app my phone started freezing up, acting weird. Dont know if it was this app or aliexpress. Seems to be more fake businesses on there then legit ones being they say if it doesnt say verified or have soo many reviews dont trust. Well this app allows the both. But my issue was with how my phone was acting up once downloaded the two apps. This one and aliexpress. When i deleted the two my phone was still acting a little weird but not as bad. Just saying be cautious"
Shenzhen Shiwang Technology Co. Ltd. are a highly professional company with quality products. We source their Alonefire UV torches and have had excellent service and shipping times to Australia with our most recent order arriving in less than two weeks!
The site is great in theory but the messaging system has a lot of bugs and need much improvement. The organization system for the messages is confusing and it doesn t update by its self it seems
good partnership
Just as ordered! Shipped quickly! Representative was professional and efficient!
This company condones fraudulent sellers on their website. The sellers will change prices of items and even send cheaper versions of items for more than brand name. When reported they don t care. And the trade assurance is another scam. They will always side against you. You will lose money with this app.
"Delivery : made earlier than expected
Quality : all rolls were intact, firm condition.
*** The box condition was amazing, it was fresh made!
Design : Simple, yet fine. loved the engraved design.
Service : PIC Lisa was very helpful, responsed 24/7.
if you are looking for eco-friendly items, Lisa is definetly the one who should discuss in the first place :)"
"I keep having the same frustrating video ad pop up in the  details  portion of the product listing. It s very frustrating & I can t see important details because of it. It happens on the website sometimes too, that s why I downloaded the app. Can someone please tell me how to eliminate this bug???"
"I started my own business two years ago using alibaba and to me Every supplier has deliver and meet multiple suppliers, some of them work with you and some make it a little hard.

Thank you"
I recommend using it for everyone who wants make money at Home!
"The items are nice with a lot of choices, the app have some issues about shipping and total cost, but overall is nice"
"Overall, this app is really good for directly connecting you to manufacturers and outsourcing products. There are some flaws with the app however; some of the promotional features in the messages section do not work or take a very long time. The product list takes a long time to load sometimes. The app sometimes crashes."
I ve never bought any thing from you yet but looking for word to doing so. But what I have done by looking into things I ve always had great luck so I m hoping to maybe sell your battery operated cars here in the United States of America sir Thank you very much and I m giving you a rating if 5 stars because so fare I ve been very happy with you and some small products has been very good Thank you Rick Gilhousen U.S.A.

"Be aware of Nonava Company run by Vanden Boom Marissaon on Alibaba.

Alibaba Nonava link below: be1557909408gtyt.trustpass.alibaba.com

I was trying to just connect with them on Alibaba, and right away they wanted to go to WhatsApp to start the scam. I asked a few questions and the person got irritated about me asking questions.
That's why they have no reviews on Alibaba, because they drag people to WhatsApp, and there are no sales records on Alibaba for people to complain about it or put bad reviews.

I also found that they scammed someone using the same method, the difference was that that poor person ended up sending money and never got what he ordered, then he reached out to them again and they blocked him, then a text came from another number asking for more money so they can send the items that he ordered.

So be very careful."
This app truly makes business fun again!
I Enjoy different vendors i dont just stick to one & im never disappointed
Thanks to Ali express the richness and Quantity of available products to choose from !
I totally love this site. It has helped me and my business so much. I highly recommend
I have pretty much concluded that the majority of products sold here is junk. They will pirate name brand items but it does not work. Most of product comes from China and lives up to their terrible reputation of selling cheap nonfunctioning garbage. Once you order it that is it you are stuck with something that don t work.
It s stuck at email verification process. Never ending load screen.
"seller very helpful. The product arrived just in time. Reliable seller, quality product."
"But I m getting ready to, these prices in salon equipment are great!  Will be back to let ya know."
Lovely
Search is complete. Useful
"Very easy to navigate.
Trustworthy.
Efficient and fast.
Will use again."
"I am happy with the deal. Many thanks to Nicole Tang. I explained everything, prompted, kept up to date with the movement of the parcel. The product matches the description. I recommend you to cooperate."
"When people go to a website, the last thing they want is to wrestle with the website. And forcing them to download an app before entering your website is another turn off. If I see something online and it forwards me to your website, I m ready to get on the website, not go thru tons of stages. Geesh!!"
delivered as stated. product was new as purchased. seller replied to all communication even if I delayed.
This is the best app if you are starting a small business. Please do your research and read reviews and see how long the manufacturers have been in business. Most have videos of their business doing normal daily orders.  
I received my orders although it took them a little longer than what they should.
Great app I love it for purchasing
Great products at reasonable prices !!!!
"Working with this company was great. Quick quotes, good recommendations and quick shipping. All of the products that I got are great quality and I couldn't be happier. Highly recommend this supplier and will definitely work with them again in the future!"
I've experienced good communications with Alibaba and have had no issues with my first two import orders.
"International platform should like this, the best crowd 24/7 only here we get anything from anywhere by anytime....simply outstanding :)"
Alibaba is world number one website I love it
Thai app is very good for stuff it s just one thing that s not them it the people I deal too!
I tried working with this people but it s not easy. I got a 1000 mask and they came all sticked together with duck tape and couldn t resell most of it due to the damage the the tape did to it s cover. Then I got few gadgets and they did not work. The last thing I paid was some cat toys that never came and I never got a refund. I do not recommend this place to anybody. It s just a booster time energy and money. Very stressful working with them. However the app is good.
"This app is a fraud. I had the worst experience ever, a seller stole my money and never sent any of my items, and she refused to send back the money. The website was not helpful in solving the matter."
Love this app
"I downloades the alibaba app, went good for a while then all of a sudden my messages stopped opening, keeps jumping to my home screen everytime i touch the message box! Fix please, this is my business on the line, i cant communicate with factories unless i have direct contact!!!! Sad!"
"Peter Yang was horrible to deal with l. Unhelpful and when I questioned him, he threw me out of the facebook group and blocked me on Facebook instead of helping my situation."
The app still has some kinks to work out. For instance you can t go back once you are in a suppliers store. You have to exit the app and go back in.
Excellet
"Needs to be a way of obtaining reasonable shipping rates. With a $800 shipping quote from a seller for a $300 furniture piece, the product cost more than double here in US. Sellers identify ability to fill small orders, but don t offer reasonable shipping."
"The whole process of ordering, shipment and delivery is very smooth with little or no surprises. Alibaba makes it very easy to order anything and to be assured of quality service all the way up to delivery of the goods"
The seller understands my needs well and does everything fast and good quality goods
Excellent service and delivery
"Most suppliers are scammers especially those advertising DJ equipment and Alibaba never helps to retrieve the money back
Please stop trusting suppliers from this platform
They are all scammers
I dealt with 3 suppliers now but I have never received my parcels"
"They protect their own Chinese sellers, but, not the foreign buyers. Even when you show that the seller has clearly cheated you, they shrug and throw like 10% of your purchase price your way, hoping to shut you up."
Prompt response to query. Received sample in less than a week.
Worst app
"Great app really good B2B platform, I recommend to anyone looking to increase business overall sourcing"
Alibaba is a super super online store selling goods and wares of others with trust and satisfaction.
"Customer service chat feature from Jayden is terrible...he takes very long to reply, then gives one word replies, that don't really answer any questions....two days, and I still haven't gotten my question answered or my order confirmed."
Alibaba is fantastic great price great service and reliable..
"Good Product & packing, Fast shipping.
Reliable and excellent customer service.
Order Delivered to my specifications.
Will do business again.A+++
Many Thanks to Leah Cai for help me."
Alibaba is a great company to look for suppliers for any e-commerce business. Products are high quality and the customer service is amazing as well. Alibaba is making my business thrive.
"I recently had the pleasure of using Alibaba.com for my business needs, and I couldn't be happier with the experience. The platform is incredibly user-friendly, and I was able to easily find and connect with suppliers who offered the products I needed at competitive prices.

One of the features I particularly liked was the ability to filter search results by various criteria, such as product category, supplier type, and location. This made it easy to narrow down my options and find the best suppliers for my needs.

I also appreciated the level of transparency and communication throughout the process. The suppliers I worked with were responsive and provided detailed information about their products and services, which gave me confidence in my purchasing decisions.

Overall, I would highly recommend Alibaba.com to anyone in need of quality products and reliable suppliers. The platform is a great resource for businesses of all sizes, and I will definitely be using it again in the future."
Good quality product and great the supplier support
"I think the website is built very nicely however I was not able to give him a question about photos of the vehicle. Please contact me back I m very interested in the
in the taxi"
App is very slow and it crashes a lot. Difficult to organice chat conversations.
Plain and simple
"Very convenient for sourcing something we needed, thanks to Alibaba provided this plate form."
"I am a REAL person. I cannot buy anything with my credit card on this site. It is a VISA card and they supposedly take VISA card, but it won t let me pay with mine. I m not gonna buy anything off this website if I can t use my card. Paying with the other methods is a rip-off. I m not paying the $25 fee to pay with the T/T method. I rate this website 0/10 and do not recommend using it AT ALL."
"Keep in mind you are purchasing cheap products from China! They DO NOT do business like US. They do not support or protect customers satisfaction. Sellers take an extensive shipment period and once products arrive damaged, apparently you fall out of the 30 days money back guaranteed. Buyers have zero support even after you send proofs of poor manufactured products. After they reviewed complaints descriptions, they send you an  we re sorry we can not further assist you with this matter. Please contact your seller  What a joke! Considering you paid hundreds on products in advance in good faith!"
"Very Important Note to Mr Jack Ma!
Alibaba is a good opportunity for anyone to become a seller  
But also a HUGE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY for Scammers to easily lead the buyers outside of Alibaba s Transaction Server to Steal from them!
Alibaba MUST do something about it, Either Don t let Sellers to Divert Transaction elsewhere, Or Set up live contract between both parties to guarantee the safety!

Otherwise 

Alibaba is just dragging everyone in it s community to use it s Website without ACTUAL responsibility!
Which means nothing but Scamming every single user by just luring people in a famous but rather not safe community!
Please put my words in consideration.
Thanks "
"A nightmare with these in China, just spent over 4 days trying to find my shipment from China to the UK, and a waste of time, no one knows anything.
Do not use this shipping service I was always with Fedex, but told Aibaba was better due to the low cost.... what a total nightmare!"
"World business in one place ,,, it s awesome"
This app is easy to use

"Good products, great prices."
Most manufacturer are fake or don t soak or read English yet they have their company and product descriptions in English. But when u message them you waste ur time and you cannot review the manufacturers. Horrible!
I ve been trying to order for over three weeks now. Dana with customer service hasn t responded to me in 5 days even though I ve sent follow up emails. Very frustrating and poor customer service.
Ordered a grey shelf received a black one the rest of the order incomplete and some not as described will not be ordering again
"Ordered from Foshan Ouyad on Alibaba and Alibaba does not honour their trade dispute guarantee. AVOID! This was first dispatched to the wrong country, then when it eventually came it was a COUNTERFEIT knock off. The inverter has NO SAFETY GROUND for output. Uses an old copy of stolen Infini firmware so DOES NOT OPERATE IN PARALLEL. The inverter is very poorly made in every aspect exceptionally LOW QUALITY very cheaply made. Seller agreed to resell the inverter and refund but still fighting five months later. DO NOT BUY from this company."
Sara provides great customer service. Good product! Highly recommended!
The app is very user friendly.but the chat is a little bit slow.overall is a good app!
"Super reliable seller, excellent product condition and fast delivery. It was like buying on amazon or any other type of local service. Im very impressed. (Delivered to Toronto Canada)"
So far very easy to manage!
"Was gonna order  a few clothing items from alibaba until I read most of the reviews. Looks like they scam sometimes, not taking that chance."
Thkas For fast respond and good service
This manufacturer was ok though
"I recently had a great buying experience with a manufacturer on Alibaba. The communication with the manufacturer was prompt, clear, and professional. They provided detailed product information, including pricing, shipping, and packaging options.

Once I placed my order, the manufacturer kept me updated throughout the entire production process, providing regular updates and photos of the products as they were being manufactured. The quality of the products was excellent, and they were delivered on time as promised.

Overall, I was extremely satisfied with my experience with this Alibaba manufacturer. Their communication, attention to detail, and quality of products exceeded my expectations. I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a reliable and trustworthy manufacturer on Alibaba."
"ordered a phone to see how good they were. They waited a week after being paid to send goods, which then made a slow journey towards UK, got as close as a (Unknown) parcel hub Rugby and there they remain into second week. Customer services are indifferent hop i will get refund will not be using this company again"
I can t use this app because I created my account by logging in with google and don t have another password. Please make google sign in an option here like it is on your website.
Extremely happy with Alibaba!! So glad I found this site!
"We bought preserved flowers from a supplier via Alibaba. We received the products and the quality of the products was not as per the photos and videos the supplier had sent us. It was so poor that we can't even sell the flowers to customers. We tried going through the trade assurance, demanding a $16,800USD refund (which is approximately 50% of the total amount we paid), however after uploading more than enough photos and videos, and writing lengthy explanations, Alibaba's trade assurance team suggested a $400USD credit instead. This was absolutely appalling and explained that they thought the products were sent out good quality and was instead damaged during shipment. It was impossible that the product was damaged during shipment as the goods were hand packaged and hand tied so that the flowers were damaged and unusable. Alibaba is a waste of time and money, and would never deal with them again."
More product you can get here
Was Told I was covered by assurance so went a head and took a risk buying a item  for 1100$ was unhappy with the pieces tried to return it was told I couldn t return by buyer opened to disputes and Still Nothing Honestly Nothing Like EBay Definitely A Huge SCAM BEAWARE SCAM
okokokfdsaadfsd
"I can never get what I m looking for, search engine seems to be random, always get something different than what I m looking for, it s trash!! Trash!! Hate this app."
This is one of good place to find useful supply.
"Excellent. The badges and the trade assurances, built trust in me before selecting a supplier. As a first time buyer, this was very reassuring and it paid off. I was able to find an excellent supplier who was super professional and dedicated to providing a stellar product for my company."
Shipping fee is too expensive to malaysia
I really love the access I have to products and manufacturers and all at my fingertips.
"You have Good Customer Service I cannot wait to meet you on the Tour. 
Thank You,
Kareem Davis"
Love every products received so far through this app
"Super long story made short i ordered some card pullers from a 4.5 star seller i paid to have it here within 2 weeks got it after 2 months and didnt not receive what i paid for it was someone else s order, The seller harrassed me for for WEEKS to send the other person their order but never wanted to send me mine, finally after being woken up various times at midnight by phone calls from the seller and being called names i sent the other person their package the next day paid for shipping and was told i would get reimbursed the shipping cost and still waiting to either get my refund, my order and what i spent on shipping. I talked to customer service a week ago and i am yet to hear back with a resolution. I got Scammed $60"
This is a great tool but the amount of spam that gets sent through the inbox from suppliers also makes it quite an annoyance.
Just heard about it and it s mind blowing to use so far
"It was quick, easy, and very helpful."
I will like to buy two of the units
Easy to work with. Fast shipment and turn around. High quality leather and the design was extremely accurate.
"great service, good communication, order was complete, nice products, no problems at all, I am very satisfied"
A trust inspiring experience! Alibaba's platform is well laid out and makes it easy to identify trustworthy companies to work with. The process of communicating and ordering from companies seems very well managed by the platform and ensures that the customer is well protected from scammers. Will definitely use Alibaba again!
"I ve been using Alibaba for a while now, and I just recently got the app. Everything has been working fine, however my main problem is when I try to communicate with a seller (or anyone), I can t see the full messaging screen. The messages are covered by the  Messages | Contacts  window to the left, and I can never read the whole thing. Idk if there s already a solution for this, but I will always have to end up switching to safari or my computer to read the whole messages since they get cut off, it s ridiculous."
"Easy to steal your money buy getting you to send cash and not sending stuff or 
Stuff to good to be true 
They ask you to use a cash app of money gram Western Union all of these are unsecure"
It s nice to know that there s a bridge of communication between the little person like myself in the many manufacturers that are at my fingertips.
I ordered 3 samples on 4/16 and the order came in 4/28. Yes I will be oedering more
"That's quite a good experience to work with Ningbo Grace. Also for Alibaba, it's lucky to find this supplier with high ability to offer the best price and fast delivery. Nice talk with their sales, quite professional service."
"Always helpful, continuous updates of production, items are always top notch quality! Customer service they go above and beyond!"
So easy to find things using this app 
"Professional, quick response to questions. Would definitely refer they re site to anyone."
I like it. Just that
"Good morning,
I received everything, in line with my expectations, very nice objects, I will come back and I recommend !!
Perfect logistics, as well as regular information that keeps us informed of all the progress, nothing to say, I recommend!!!"
Simply user friendly website 
"For this company to be so out of country, their site is very well put together, so that I was able to understand and wait for an email for my direct interest if my purchase."
"I am very march interested in a price on your transportation equipment, any chance of getting a price list on all of your 4 wheel 4 wheeler s and Jeep type and 4x4  and scooter type transportation, not interested in electrical ones , gas and diesel only"
The invitation is tremendous. Products beautiful. Technology current. Glad to have located you.
Most of the suppliers in China are not able to reply during our hours of operation and a lot of the suppliers have a poor understanding of what is asked of them and when they get frustrated they cancel everything and it s like you never spoke to them every time you asked him something it s like trying to solve an equation like 2+_plus_plus_plus_equals 178 you can t seem to figure out the answers in between
Very well and use full appss
Easy to navigate.
"What made my experience great was Miruko Zhang, the ability to stay in communication with me even though I'm 12 hrs away was great, I am very respectful for all the service that was given to me the entire time and answering every question I had in a timely professional manner..! Much thanks and appreciation..!"
"It s horrible every time I go on I type my credentials and it goes back to the login screen. I log in on their website through my browser and it works and logs in with no problem. I tried on multiple phones and same issue. I currently have an IPhone 11 Pro Max and still doing the same. In terms of buying and selling, takes forever but just have to be patient and hope it gets delivered in good condition."
"alibaba.com have many products of china, But you should be select supplier that long time of gold supplier for confident in QCD (Quality, Cost, Delivery)."
Too complicated to use and the synchronization is too long
"There is a problem in importing photos from the mobile phone, either it is the last or it will 
be an unselected photo.

But overall it is a great and useful app"
This a great site. that is full of plenty of options for what I am looking for. Since I have been using Alibaba I have had an all around great experience. Great customer service who is always more than will to help with any issues that might come up.
Work great and easy to use.
"I ordered three solar inverters from soeasy Xiamen and some solar panels via but the solar panels were held by customs and one of the inverters had a broken display connection but Alibaba and Soeasy Xiamen ignored my messages and did not provide any product support, repairs or refund"
"We bought goods from china, specification were given and confirmed.The good arrived but were faulty and wanted rectification or refund, But the seller was not willing to refund, rectify.
Then Ali Baba tried to resolve the matter but did so for the seller when there were evidence to show that buyer is right, yet Ali Baba sided with seller (maybe because it is Chinese)"
This app gives you access to anything you need cheap
User Friendly app. Loves searching for things I like for my business.
"New here from Texas ! 
Find App Very User Friendly !! 
Good Job !!"
Product stopped working and provider not offering solution to ensure steady service.
I am using samsung mobile its very good mobile in the would iam setisfing with samsung galaxy f42
"Great app for business to business transaction.

Bad app only if you are a moron."
I like this apps coz easy for me to find supplier direct from any country in this world.
Seller was extremely helpful and professional during all stages of the ordering process. Product is of the highest quality and I'll be ordering again!
Their coordination between their vendors and our company. They ensure that communications between our company and their suppliers is timely and followed up. Very helpful
I m sorry but Im getting pretty close to just deleting this app!! I have tried purchasing a few items and they keep trying to make deals via whatsup app and email! Also I seem to be getting quotes for higher prices than what s advertised thank you
I clicked to not receive promotional notifications but I still get them. They are annoying and intrusive
"A must resource for any savvy business. Diversify your resources, so you have options when looking for alternative suppliers."
The service was very fast easy to communicate with and just what I was looking for.
"Starting a business, and with all that entails I love the clear, concise information on this app. Very user-friendly!"
You can find everything.
I asked if my product can be expedited since I was really in need of the product for a job and my request was granted.
For 3 years I have seen countless frauds coming from Pakistan.  Most are under age teens acting as if they are owners of factories.  Many friends have been lied too cheated and had horrible stories after sending money through western union and money gram to these fakes.  There are only 7 factories in Pakistan that make gloves and the government should do something about this problem.
very good company and very easy to work with and extremely good quality products very good experience especially my first time shopping on Alibaba
Hi I really enjoyed this app and it s very worth in purchasing products but sad to say after purchasing they say they don t have shipping service to Sri Lanka  please try to fix that option then all Sri Lankan s can purchase products from Ali baba
"""I had the pleasure of testing the portable monitor and I must say that I was really impressed. The image quality is incredible, with sharp and vivid colors that make every detail even more noticeable. Thanks to the Full HD resolution, the images appear extremely detailed and well-defined.

Furthermore, the convenience of the product is simply fantastic. The monitor is lightweight and compact, easy to carry wherever you want. The protective case provided allows you to travel with the monitor without worrying about any damage during transport.

The connection technology is equally impressive: you can connect the monitor to a laptop or another device via HDMI or USB-C cable. This way, you can use the portable monitor as a second screen and work on two screens simultaneously efficiently.

In summary, if you are looking for a high-quality portable monitor, I highly recommend the model. With its amazing image quality and convenience of the product, it is an excellent choice for those who are looking for a portable monitor for work or entertainment."""
"As im new to alibaba.com,i have an issue to login and register. I use multiple email but still same, which is failed to login. Please help me"
Very interesting
"Many functions do not work, website much more interactive."
This is the first time I use it. So amazing so far.
I use to love this app but now it won t let me login anymore I m pretty upset I had yrs of jewelry saved on my wishlist that will take forever to find again .
"My first time shopping from Alibaba
I have over 100+ purchases from Aliexpress
My product reached me with no problem
If I didn't receive my product, I don't think there would be a problem in the dispute since it belongs to Aliexpress.
If it says that you can buy a maximum of 10 products on the products, in the description; Contact Seller creates order for you
Please note that in some countries, there is a limit to one-time shopping for personal purchases due to the fact that the product is sold for commercial purposes.
Therefore, be aware of the laws of our country when shopping, or customs will confiscate the product.
For example, the limit is 4 in Turkey.
Good Day"
So far so good let s see how timing goes when ordering... wish me luck... to be continued....
"Hi,it's a really fantastic app for worldwide business and is really helpful for buyers internationally. But this time I am searching for prize which showing by Ali express???"
"My experience on Alibaba is Horrible. Feel like most of chinese suppliers are Cheating. My first supplier asked more charge from me after I transferred payment with Wireless transfer. So I had to cancel it costed me waste my transfer fee. Second supplier ( air transportation service) is more horrible.I paid them fast air ( most expensive)which will take around 10 days as they said , but actually it taking around 20 days n no update for my items yet. So disappointed and full of horrible App ever I had shopping."
"How long for delivery to Texas? 
I ll need the lowest price possible as it will be for me and my son. 
How many miles will I be able to drive on one charge? 
Thank you, 
Kelli"
very easy to communicate with suppliers. they are always willing to offer you good products and good prices.
The merchant told me my item was $3200 and once shipped says there is $1000 in importing fees that I must pay or get fined from the USA government.  They say the forms must be filled out ASAP but the credit card fraud claim takes 60 days. So it s a huge mess. I ll never ever buy anything from alibaba again.
Top B2B whole selling app
"its useless after updating lastest version, cant no longger find a product that clearly showed before minutes earlier before updating"
Easy to use!
I shouldn t say this but there s no other place for quality pricing for quality equipment then this place. if I shop somewhere else I m only cheating myself.
Whoever made this app forgot to add the Escrow option in the search filter section. I need to look for suppliers that won t scam me by using escrow services. Please tell your developers to add it else this app is useless. I will change ratings once I see it again.
AliBaba knows what customer wants. Simplicity! Simplicity! Simplicity! That s about everything for any user! Few clicks you get what you want! Awesome!
ok
Part was correct as ordered and arrived in good time. Completely satisfied with the purchase process and delivery.
Reliable and fast business
BUYER BEWARE - Disgusting company. Their suppliers sent a completely different quality product to the sample and they believe I this is appropriate for their supplier to do. This is appalling and Alibaba does not support their customers at all.
It has lots things to sale I will be customer  to buy verities of good and sale to other from my store . We are looking whole sale price  thank  I  looking positive response . Thank
"It took 20 minutes for the system to accept the information entered , which was all correct. Your system is extremely slow, and there for frustrating. 3 stars because it did eventually work."
"STAY AWAY FROM ALIBABA.COM
PURE SCAMMERS GOT CONNED OUT OF  3000 USING TRADE ASSURANCE. FALSIFIED SHIPPING COMPANY AND DELIVERY TO PORT OF IRELAND. USING THIS COMPANY NAME GuangZhou BJ Cosmetics Co.,LTD.....STAY AWAY SCAMMERS..
TRADE ASSURANCE DONT WANT TO KNOW.
FRANCIS GARNIER AND DORA MA AND MIKE DAVIS BIG CULPRITS USING A COSMETIC COMPANY AS DECOY. NEVER EVER BUY FROM ALIBABA AS ALL THEM ARE SCAMMERS..."
"This apps sits and is ok with having scammers and bad lying suppliers on their app. You can apply for a refund with full evidence between you and a supplier and they still side with them, now you re left with no product and wasted time and Money!"
"Ease to use and friendly.
Now have to wait for the return of
the seller."
Great Experience And Easy to communicate with Suppliers
The staff was very help. Casssie really help me thought the process. She was very good with communicating with me what I need to do. She made sure that I was happy with the product.
"I am new to starting my cosmetic line and Amy has been doing very well with helping get the products I need, I look forward to working with her again. She is so kind and friendly"
They will advertise an MOQ and then bully you in chat to make it a bigger order with all types of nonsense reasons as to why it had to be more. I ll never come here again.
"Just like most 1 star, Alibaba ONLY protect their own Chinese suppliers. The Trade Assurance SUCKS and they will NOT help when there is a problem.
I got scammed for $3000.00 Never got the USB drives and now again with another order. Seller sends toner cartridges that will not work but does not want to replace the wrong installed chips on the cartridges."
"for autoparts dont buy at this FAKE SCAM company
they send wrong parts and second hand

Guangzhou Tangshen Auto Parts Co., Ltd.
name of the owner is Mr. Peng"
"Easy and fast shipping of the products, without messing about."
"I bought here and I never received anything they extorted me I opened a dispute and the supplier disappeared and they did not help me at all and I lost my money, this place is not safe I thought it was"
"Im very pleased with the app, I find everything I need in reliable time!"
Process my order very well had no trouble ordering with noHassle
i m by this Buy this produce and I couldn t be more happier the Cable is good the seller is really transparent and the shipment is fast I do recommend this one
Vary good this app I need to register my company on Ali Baba. I find it difficult to register and I would like to pay and receive through the site. Is it even possible to provide assistance? I send you the company papers and tax number for help. Thank you
cant trust suppliers goods are not as described be very careful when purchasing
"really good supplier, very kind sales person. great quality products and very fast shipping and the package is very safe too"
The product was delivered as promised what can be better than that.
"Good service, fast, friendly and willing to help."
"Chinese companies who are at this app is horrible, you ask something they reply something you don t want. It s frustrating and I will never use this app to get chinese traders"
Was browsing their website and their description on items shows they have no idea what they're selling. 'Man made glass carnelian bowls' is my favourite example. They are glass bowls. They are man made. Thwy are glass. They are not carnelian. They are not man made glass carnelian. Man made carnelian doesn't exist. Nor does glass carnelian. It's either glass or carnelian it can't be both
I love Alibaba for the versatility
How can I be assured product I order will be shipped?
"I am recomending this company about service, quality and fast shipping, additionaly the kind attention of Jessie"
My experience was very good everything ran smoothly and communication was very clear
"The rep Wendy gets 10 stars. She is amazing! She is patient, fast and very understanding. I absolutely love working with her. I am upset that the one pair of shoes that I ordered came in poor condition and there has been no effort to rectify the problem or the defect."
On time reply and good understand of what I need is key for me and this supplier provided me these.
"I've only had positive experiences on Alibaba. I have dealt with over 15 factories/suppliers on the platform and all of them were genuine, attended to my queries and shipped my products on time.

Their trade assurance payment system is also very secure. Until I confirm that I have received my goods or the courier tracking says ""delivered"", I can still receive a full refund.

Keep it up Alibaba!"
"These are not height-increasing shoes   this regular shoes.
It is impossible to wear because when you walk, the heel flies out with every step. The foot is unreliably fixed inside the shoe and is very poorly held, and you can easily expose your foot. The inside insole has absorbed all of the internal space, and there is no room for foot coverage.
I am very disappointed with this purchase.
Please find a solution to the problem, a refund, or a good discount on the following order, or free delivery of the following order.

Videos are large, so I put them on YouTube, please look at these links two videos, which in confirmation of my words, prove that these sneakers can not be worn."
"So yea the app is good and has a little problem but the one problem i really hate is the shipping so i was going to order something then saw the price of the shipping was $30,000,00 It Immediately KO me because damn with that money might as well buy a new house"
i have very good experience with all time
Lovely app and great photos I m finding no direction on how to pay???? Concerned
"I have made a number of purchases using Alibaba. Everyone I have dealt with has been highly professional, polite, responsive, and the products arrived timely and were of good quality."
Alibaba will simple not help if it comes to an dispute. Even if you provide super clear evidence of a unusable product the decided to not refund and make it hard to get your right. Alibaba shame on you!
"The entire transaction was very smooth and the product was shipped to our door. Communication was excellent and in excellent English to boot. The product is made to last a long time, and the pricing is very reasonable."
I use both online and smart phone app. I've learned to navigate the app just as good as online. In fact love using the app due to the ease of use.
Fantastic
Thank you for opening up new opportunities for us to purchase our business product from China. The entire experience has helped our business grow!
The hair looks amazing heard nothing but great things I would love to try them as well.
GREAT SUPPORT  GREAT SELLER  FROM MEXICO IT WAS A GREAT SERVICE  ANG GREATS ITEMS 
"The Agents were very kind, the product is perfect and the price is good, the delivery was on time, the experience was very good in general."
I purchased a battery never received it. Nobody wants to talk about giving me my money back. I think AliExpress is a rip off.
On the new update for iPad when you type a message to someone it keeps on saying  pasted from iPad  at the top. Kind of annoying but nothing bad.
This app is one of the best you could ever use . GO CHECK IT OUT
Nice
"I love this 3D wood world map! It's so detailed and the wood grain adds a nice touch.
This is a stunning piece of art that I am so happy to display in my home. The quality is excellent and it was easy to hang on my wall"
"Alibaba's invoice system is not acceptable.
They charged additional hidden fee."
I have been waiting for product going on 2 months ! Never again
"I have done multiple orders with this supplier. All the products have arrived on-time. I really like working with Lee. He does like to try to get you to buy new products constantly. I respect his hustle. He's always been fair with me, honest, and helpful. Even gives pertinent advice on how to structure Ebay and Amazon sales.

Thanks Again!"
The best  
"Thank you for a great AP. Very easy to use and organize information,"
I was able to order this and even got the shipment faster than expected. The quality of the devices are way better than I expected. I am looking forward to getting them installed on my bus. Thanks for everything. The service team for ordering was super responsive and helpful.
i like this
Better be ready to negotiate with many people. You could be at 3.25 and others offer it for $35
I wasted months doing research on the perfect items to purchase for my boutique just to finally attempt to make a purchase and found out the site doesn t take debit cards. They say the do but they lied. Instead you have to pay $25 fee for bank wire which is ridiculous.  The customer service rep were absolutely no help. They acted like this was not an issue and kept telling me to do a wire transfer which took longer to get approved.
I enjoy shopping on Alibaba and have never had any issues. Great products and supportive suppliers.
