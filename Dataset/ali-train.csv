"I ve bought mostly everything for my business from Alibaba. Most of the suppliers I ve dealt with have been great - I ve received what I ordered pretty quickly. Just recently, I had an order go horribly wrong when a supplier took months to even mail out my package, and then it was not what I ordered. I messaged them, and they basically told me to just deal with it and would not make it right. They said if I wanted a refund, I had to pay to ship the items that were not what I ordered back, and the shipping cost was most of what I paid. I was nervous about how Alibaba would handle it. I definitely will continue shopping here after the experience - I was issued a full refund and did not have to pay to ship what I did not order back (thank goodness). Thank you, Alibaba."
The best app for businesses trying to cut out the middle man.
I am satisfied with the delivery and quality of the product
very easy communication and very helpful service
I first ordered glasses as the product described then the seller said that they didnt do 3d logo and sent me silk printing I told them to continue just cause i didnt want to cause a big problem when they sent me pictures it was not centered and they had scratches so I told them i didnt want them they assured me that they will get me new glasses and that they will be centered they sent me the items when I received them out of 100 only 3 glasses were good I did the refund right away and have been denied 6x and cant get in contact with anyone and the seller refuses to give me my money back total loss alibaba is a fraud.!.!.
"Because I just used this platform and everything is still unfamiliar, this company feels pretty good. Yes, but I can't give more information right now and need to be lifted more to have more insight."
"Excelent service, give you peace of mind."
"I have yet to order anything yet, however I own a little small lot at a fair, I m preparing to order something, it all looks good at decent price."
Interaction with supplier for clarity and also work together towards a satisfactory transaction
Alibaba is a well known and reliable company worldwide.
"The great thing was that I had never placed an order like this in China and was well looked after from the first contact. Ms. Nina Hwang from WAAG deserves a special mention, as she always gave me the best advice with her friendliness, patience, helpfulness and competence. I had a good feeling from the first contact. I was informed at all times about the completion processes as well as the packaging and shipping. The product has become excellent and the original is even better than the photos previously suggested. Arrived on time in Germany, well packaged and easy to install. Thank you very much."
Same problem even change the wifi line . Cannot open messenger and notification
High quality
"The ease of communication was very easy, great price and amazing delivery time."
"I like Alex press and enjoy many of the products. I would like to know about the shipping possibilities if they could be a little quicker is that possible? And I would also like to inquire about the quantities that can be ordered. Four instance, is there a possibility of ordering a smaller amount for now until the business begins to grow a little bigger and the demand gets better then expand to a larger amount? Thank you for your concerns. Jimmie Rivera, Allentown Pennsylvania USA"
"From start to delivery, a smooth process. All questions answered and great service. No issues with language barriers. Products arrived very well packaged, no damage in transit from initail breif inspection. I woudl be happy to recomend."
Be very careful using I had bad experience with scammer seller on this app even after dispute case was opened twice they couldn t solve the issue and the scammer got away with it.
I ordered product and can t get anyone to tell me when it is supposed to ship. I asked for a refund and it s been processing for a week. I will never order anything else!
"Often times when you inquire they say contact us at WhatsApp, we ll that s an immediate Red Flag and almost certainly A downright scam! Can t trust it."
"Hello there, I do you like your site a lot of interesting things,  I m just wondering if you have are US distributor ? Thank you have a great day. Gay"
"Not only did the supplier take a long time to reply, they were also very rude. Would never recommend to the app to anyone"
"Easy to use 
& so many product in app for your choice"
Went I ask are questions the price in MYR and he answer me in USD . Went I tell him y your pic show in MYR and he told me u go to LAZADA to buy?? Is very bad service tq for your corporate 
"Easy to use, simple instructions and user-friendly"
I love vegetables so I would to test this rack out and it s a great space saver
"Alibaba is a great app!! There's all the information you need as regards to online trade. You can talk to various companies personnel, check the prices and even negotiate with them online. You can equally make payments directly into the account of the company you're dealing with."
App is very user friendly.  All of the suppliers have English as a 2nd or 3rd language so sometimes things don't translate over clearly and can be a bit hard to understand.
To be honest the site desires 5 star but because Iran in not among country list made me upset. Hope Iran to be added in the country list. Bussiness is Bussiness not politics. As I see Iran is the only country that omitted. Thanks in advance.
Great app!!!
Nicholas and his company were able to help me is so many ways. Very quick response and turnaround to my questions and changes. Very happy with the quality. ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND!!!
"It is safe and fast to order from Alibaba, I bought some lights and they are awesome."
Amazing experience with a quality product
I try order to kitchen staff to my store and make order sending the funds and nothing. The supplier told me everything is okay and cargo will be in the customs within 30 days but after 27 days they just silently send my money back without any notification
Everyone in this company was very nice and courteous with my needs. They also sent my sample by air so I can receive it in timely manner and decide with my purchase. Thank you.
Alil baby u have been clutch for the most parted if I have any suggestion I ll let you know so far everybody is communicative and understanding
Great website to buy whatever you want and need to make your business a success.
"After I send the link to the clients from their website, they seem not to get the image and since as buyers we request a lot of quotes for a lot of product CT s, it is difficult to go back and search the items. Once buyer send the link to the seller from their site they should be able to look at it and quote it. I have Bemni asked Alaina and again what kind of products I need from different sellers after I send hyphen their link. Also from the chat I couldn t find what I have asked them because the link was not there anymore..."
"Good app, easy to use and gives good recommendations for similar products."
All good so far
Easy to find a variety
Love the clothes.. will be ordering more
I m having some issues because my app keep sticking and cutting off 
They put up listings and then when they get your money they tell you they won't ship it and so you lose your money. Untrustworthy scammers.
What I liked the most about the company was its genuine willingness and commitment to do business with me despite the fact that was not looking for many qualities.
The app has bugs and there aren t anymore reviews! Bring back the reviews!!!! How can you just buy something without checking the product reviews. News flash!! You can t.
Good shopping Approved
I was able to trade the product smoothly.
"Keeping its commitments.
Good communication"
"The app is very user friendly and I like the huge variety of items and wholesale prices!
I love it so far "
Great and reliable company
I love this company.And the items they have to sell.
Already on my third purchase in 2 months. So far the manufacturers I've dealt with are all legit and care about the services they provide. Are very negotiable and professional. Only problem I have is the 24/7 service. It's an auto reply machine that doesn't really help or answer any of the questions I've had so far
"Usually I don t write reviews but after using app I feel really nice and the app is so user friendly. No complaints about the app at all. But, some suppliers are literally responding so late I don t know why. I wanted to buy products from them but the supplier is not responding, it s so bad and frustrating. It s almost 6 hours but no response from him. User friendly app I can say."
"My grand daughter really likes her bank. Unfortunately, the battery died and she can not use it anymore. Please tell me how to re-enter the password again.   
                                  Thanks"
This app is by far the best wholesale app on the market if you were looking to make some extra money or looking to expand your current business or looking to start a business this app will get you moving in the right direction. My wife is a stay at home mom and we have three young children and this app has allowed us to generate an income to sustain a good lifestyle I highly recommend this app!
Solid app so far very smooth and clean. Relatively easy to navigate.
I have not not received what I pay for since December 23 and not good results from alibaba.
The app is on my phone but they won t let me delete it! They send notifications and updates but I can t find the app on my phone and so I cannot delete it.
"Although Alibaba is a great place to allow buyers and sellers to meet, most suppliers never want to use Alibaba for Trade Assurance and I see why - is is cumbersome, time-consuming, doesn t work most of the time. Alibaba has the capability for credit cards, eChecking, and TA (wire). Each take too long to deliver the payment to the supplier, and more often than not, especially with eChecking it will be cancelled at the last minute, after they take your money, and your items are waiting to get on a truck... three stars because though they have come a long way, they have a long way to go..."
Fast and easy
Seams really great till I get my first order in
super
"If you are an American buying goods, from these countries if you request a refund a day or two later. Even before they ship it off they will fight you on giving you your money back."
Great app. Suggest improvement to have a selection to combine in and out box message in same stream like SMS and email. Also to automatically synchronize with desktop outbox.
"Be very careful with who you deal with if from the USA. I asked for a quote and was contacted by multiple people. I placed an order for clothes. 20 hats, 20 beenies, 24 hoodies, 5 athletic jumpsuites and 6 wool coats. The sizes were sizes that would fit children. The embroidery wasn t finished, and won t respond to a single message now. The company was Antom Enterprises. I have asked for a return label, corrected order etc. and now they won t respond. I was asked to contact them through WhatsApp they said it would be easier and sent them the money PayPal. Do not do this. Alibaba will not help you with your order or people who scam you. They do not keep track of who contacts you based on your request. I spent over 45mins with alibaba customer service and got no where. This is the perfect site for people to scam people on. I m new to alibaba placed my first sample order for clothing and got ripped off."
Excellent product. Top quality. Friendly and smart sales girl
"Great communication, went the extra mile to meet my target dates prior to shipping Nothing was a bother"
"Henan Luxury integrated house co. Ltd are thieves
i paid the full amount after one month i didnt even get a n airway bill from them i never received my items
they keep lying to me
DONT BUY FROM THEM"
I don t understand why they could not ship to USA. I m disabled I cannot afford to buy expensive one. I found cheap one but they wouldn t ship to my address. This is not right at all! I gave you one star. I m not sorry for this. This is totally wrong!
"Excellent sticker printer, I use them for holographic, matte laminated, and vinyl stickers and the quality is outstanding. Very good customer service, and great to work with. Will order from this company over and over again, I highly recommend them."
It s better than chatting via WhatsApp because everything is readily at your fingers tips!! I can navigate between screens seamlessly! And stay on top of all communications!
"product was delivered as advertised, will recommend for more deals in the future"
Shipping by sea takes too long but you give a short time for refund applications. You need to increase that window
Thank you for your cooperation and the speed of transactions
Not sure yet. It s my try.
"Congratulations   big respect   your Item is best quality and too nice   
New York ( USA  ) love   I m always satisfied"
"Value for money, excellent communication with suppliers. Delivery on time."
"I bought an Solar hybrid inverter through Alibaba. I paid via Paypal. The inverter didn't work as advertised, and after working with the vendor for several months to resolve the issues, I decided the better thing for me to do was to request the merchant take back the inverter and refund my money. They didn't respond to my request, so I filed a complaint through Alibaba. A week or so after filing the complaint, I got a message from the merchant saying they agreed to take back the inverter and refund my money and that the process would go through Alibaba. Alibaba said they would also file to get the shipping fees reimbursed as well. I shipped the inverter back and on the day that the merchant received it, Alibaba closed communications on the dispute and I have never heard back from them since. So, now i have no inverter and no money. I have filed with Paypal too, but it is taking months longer than it should have, especially considering they have the merchandise. I would not do business with Alibaba again. Buyer beware!"
They will pressure you to buy something all the time and then report you or get rude when you don t buy from them  .
"I tried ordering car parts and everything that sellers posted was not what they were actually selling. I can get parts in USA much cheaper than what they wanted for specific brands. I paid for items before finding out sellers are false advertising and now Alibaba wants to take  10-Days  to refund my money. Also, they charged a lot of money just to process my payment. DHgate is way better than this crappy site!"
I can t manage my RFQ request on the app and because it keeps showing me the same one every time no matter how many times I click a different one or reload the app...
"Don t throw away your money with shopping from this thief, robber and scammer website, they don t care how seller lie to you, dispute team deal with seller and probably gain money standing next to seller. They are not HUMAN. 
Spend more money and shop from a fair and safe website"
I like if can connect with seller
"Since I started doing business with vendors from Alibaba, my business has grown."
App never works no matter what phone/wifi/carrier I m on. It always says network unavailable. So frustrating.
Excellent service as always. Regina is always a pleasure to deal with and will answer questions immediately. Will continue doing business with this company.
The site seems to offer many wonderful things
"Good Product, good seller, shipping on time."
A lot of material information
"The product is rooted, the Settings are easy"
"First!! Quick response...
I needed faith to deal with overseas clients.
The counselor gave me faith with quick response and expertise."
"Is it possible to shipping in Macau and Taipa.....,?"
Would like to order but need in like 2 weeks can u do thatweeekis that
About the main products it was at least cwey good
Great store. Fast and secure delivery.
"The app keeps kicking me out!!! Also, every time I attempt to by bulks of items it says the page/company  is no longer available... I m trying to legitimately start a business this is no help at all"
"Honest, good to communicate, excellent service. Product quality good."
Thank you for an easy web site to manage
I found more businesses that were part of the trade assurance program but did not accept trade assurance.  Most businesses on this ap are ones that want to scam you. My best advice is to steer away from it.  If not buyer beware.
I have wanted to stop notifications of promotions and I went and turn off promotions in the settings but it won t stop sending promotions. It s like they don t care about what you want. They will keep spamming you
Think business think good products and think right.
Pay close attention to the shipping prices they are over inflated that s why prices are so low
"I have been buying from Alibaba for over five years, and most suppliers I found are good. But you get some bad ones now and then. Alibaba says they provide trade assurance, meaning you are protected, but I don't see any protection when I make claims. Alibaba will keep telling you supplier has done the right thing. They will keep asking buyers to provide evidence, but you will not see much evidence from suppliers.
So if you found a good supplier, you are lucky; if you found the bad one, forget the chances of a refund."
This app is one of the best in recent times it makes everything I need to buy easy especial goods in China
"Amazing experience, really good products , excellent attention. SAbrina is so great, help me in all the process.
THanks!!"
Very poor app even tech savvy can't easily understand the way of chat and inquiry process in one go. Shipping charges are sometime 1000 times than the actual product. Due to so many glitches I didn't go for any shopping this time after downloading it after 5 years.
"I had a good experience with this company and particullary with Peter, I will always use their services in the future"
"If the seller scams you, Alibaba will not do anything about it. Even if you pay trade assurance. If the money are a big amount you will lose everything. Be careful. All their rules in the website are just b*** to make you feel you are covered by some sort of b***"
Alibaba is a good B2B platform. The company is responsive when things go wrong and any issues I have had with a seller (very few) have been handled to my satisfaction.
"I have been looking for products for my Niche, and I have been fortunate to be able to speak to a Representative of different suppliers and they re very nice and approachable. Thank you. The artistries of the products are very well for retailers prospective. Although, prices are excellent but shipping/freight are the challenges. 

Thank you.
Miriam"
"They show you pictures of something you like so you download the app, when you get the app the item is nowhere to be found or anything related to it"
Keep sending emails and even calling me with their promos. I bought 1 thing from them in my whole life. Leave me alone.
This app is very useful I love anything I need for my businesses I use it. Also started some great relationships with vendors
The service and quality of products are are excellent.
Is really expensive even more than the product ant is really hard to buy some stuff in the app
Beautiful
Not easy to use. Very slow. Missing product information
So far I enjoy you app to the fullest so many to choose from thank you
"Hao Tian Laser can be found on Alibaba. Pascal and his team made this transaction flow smoothly. Available to answer any question. If they say it will be done, rest assured as it will be done."
Seller had 15 days to ship my product they did not do it applied for a refund and it is a nightmare app has lots of bags will not let me select certain features but it is funny how there are no bugs when it s time to place an order. Would seriously consider sourcing elsewhere
"I wouldn't have left one star, but I had to in order to leave a review. I placed an order for (2) two items [Remote controlled iTeraCare device holders], unbeknownst to me it was coming from China. Okay it took nearly two months to be delivered, and when my package arrived it was only (1) one with NO REMOTE. As I reached out to the seller who sold the product via Alibaba, wasn't communicable; I received one email apologizing for the delay, because it was their Chinese New Year (which must be a week or so long). Long story short - I have a non-functional product, with no remote and not 2 as I paid for. I have to file dispute cases all over the place and still I am out of $291.32. I will not do business with this company again, if I can help it."
"I cant tell you how bad there customer service is. I used this app for years and nobody seemed to bother solving the problem. At this point I cant pay any of the supplier through the app. I cant explain how much time Ive lost trying to make this work but they don't seem to care. Horrible company, don't recommend at all."
"I don t understand this site,we should be able to buy without contact, we re paying for it, if we want to Ofer more, then we will ask"
"Alibaba doesn't help much, when you complain about getting the wrong product.
If you have problems with suppliers it's better to just forget about your money."
"Alibaba has a vendor like Jimmy Li from Wuhan ZG Automation Technology that advertises products like a dental scanner for $1000 when the actual price is $6000. I asked the vendor about the pricing differential and Jimmy said,  that s not the actually the price, that s just for show.  Where I come from that s false and misleading advertising!"
make more easier
Not right option
Tracking orders and shipments as well as communications with sellers is very awkward. I cannot find a list of orders that were paid for
"If you get lied to by a seller and want a canceled order, good luck getting your order canceled and your money back. I ve been lied to buy a seller and when I tried to cancel it he order 2 days after placing the order, alibaba customer service said good luck and deal with the seller directly. First and last time I will ever use this site. What a horrible experience"
As I place my very first order and see how this shipping process works I ll change my mind
"It is very nice for sellers and buyers to trade with confidence on Alibaba trading site.
In addition, Hefei Craft company we work with on trade transactions and Estelle, whom I met as a very valuable contact person, helped me a lot and we successfully completed our trade.
Our friendship and trade will continue."
I enjoy this experience because you can find everything needed!! Plus more
Thank to Alibaba apps.. this apps very help me to find a better good with the guaranteed quality.. 5 star!!!  
"Everything I have ordered and that has been for a number of years. I have been completely 100 % satisfied. I have and will continue to recommend your company to all looking for items that would cost much more to obtain even if it could be found at all. Thanks for all you have to offer everyone.
Sgt. J.K. Shipley"
"They are profesional in selling sofa and furniture parts, the quality and price is good, and also they can produce the order very fast."
"the worst experience, we paid  $3,800 dollars from me and neither the seller nor the company wants to respond to give me my money back, and the alibaba representatives can not help you at all because it is as if they understand   honestly do not buy construction drill sellers they are a scam company"
"But some traders & manufacturers displaying an offer, when you contact them you ll surprise that the price you have seen in Alibaba a dummy price!!!"
THIS COMPANY IS A RIP OFF AND DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM. MY PRODUCT NEVER ARRIVED AND I HAVE BEEN TRYING FOR WEEKS TO GET A REFUND. THEY JUST KEEP GIVING ME THE RUN-A-ROUND. BUYER BEWARE DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY FOR ANYTHING. THEY JUST LIE TO YOU TO AVOID DOING ANYTHING TO HELP. THEY ARE A BIG JOKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
thank you for making my new product devices available.
"Signed up, created my account did the verification passed and then was locked out of my account with no reason give, tried customer service but nothing."
Its really the fastest trading app I have ever seen
I m impressed with the array and choices of products you cans find here!
Quite everything am looking for @ very very affordable prices!
I m looking to operate an E bike business recently retired from the US Navy shout out leathernecks.
Alibaba works. Enables finding the right suppliers and to organize a deal in a secure and agile mode. I am a minor importer with three deals in the last month and all of them were totally succesful. Will keep on trusting this platform.
"I got scammed as well!

please take a look at the website
alibadda.com"
Great customer service . Really satisfied with the help and support and the product
Found the required item source so quick
This app is fantastic and best items and best and perfect price.
Fast shipping and Take care the customer.
"I have replied several times about a bug in the app! But nothing happens! Problem is, after updating to iOS 14, I noticed that I can t open images attached with the quotations I have received from supplier! When I click on images the App crashes & go back to my phone homepage! I m on iOS 14, iPhone X 256 GB version!"
Very nice experience - so helpful and our end product was fantastic!
"I've purchased many items from AliExpress and Alibaba and I recently purchased gold shimmer panels on Alibaba and I'm very happy with this purchase. I love the way they snap together. I used them 2 times already. One time was for a 75th birthday and just yesterday for an Indonesian cultural event combined with an organic balloon garland. Your gold shimmer panels got a lot of nice complements and children were fascinated by it. I was able to make it come alive and sparkle by hiding a fan behind it. I also attached the panels on my pipe and drape framework with black drapes behind the shimmer panels to enhance the decoration.

Here's a video of what the finished decoration I did looks like: drive.google ""dot com""/file/d/1KJQvECR63svUbulvBncjwND4WbEHG29N/view?usp=share_link

I will be using it again for this upcoming lunar new year at my son's high school Westford Academy lunar year of the rabbit event."
"The seller, Yiwu Haohao E-Commerce - Firm Contact Name: mingqin hao was very patient, very kind, very knowledgeable, and very responsive! The product was amazing, arrived on time, and packaged very well! I would recommend this product and this company and would highly recommend Mingqin Hao! THANK YOU!!"
The app keep shutting down after you open the items your are looking for and you click to go to there website in Alibaba  . Is extremely frustrating because it shutdown completely and you have to star again from the beginning to try to find the vendor .
Only thing is that at times the app can be overwhelming with so much info.
Trade was made easy and fast.
"Useless website, never order anything.... there is no guarantee of refund if product isn t satisfactory..... website supports Chinese firms not the buyer."
Obviously some great programmers involved.  Congrats
"The app is a great place to find vendors for small businesses just make sure to stay clear from scammers and check full prices. Making Payments can be tricky so make sure you fully look it through and dont send information to just any vendor. Be sure to take time to search and dont let a vendor rush you into buying, they should make u feel like they re trustworthy. Another problem is miscommunication, ask as many questions as you need so you know your getting whats worth your money!! Sometimes the price for each piece may not be as much but the shipping will be like $200 :0 if you re looking for lipgloss tubes I recommend buying from  Guangdong Qiaoyi Plastic Co., ltd.   Great customer service and communication."
I like how easy it is and it helps with all the questions we have for our clients.
They use to have online bank pay which is very convenient. Now that they take that down they want to charge you an arm and a leg for paying using credit card.
Terrible customer service. When things are delivered incorrectly they always side with the manufacturer. Be prepared for costly disappointment.
"efficient, trustworthy."
Is alibaba delivery safe in India?
My overall experience with ordering from Alibaba was good. The vendor assisted me throughout the ordering process and shipping.
"Professional suppliers.
Good quality products.
Fast delivery."
It was timely and I have never been a victim of fraud despite being a novice
the material was the same as what was displaced on ALIBABA. I like it.
"It was very recent. As a business owner, I want my thing to be on time; it was too much to ask. I paid $110 for shipping. I expected more security and well done if I spent over a hundred dollars. Again, I got 96 spoons out of 100 and 97 forks out of 100; I even did express. All I can say as a business owner is Never shop on Alibaba .com, and their customer service is SH!T. They can not help you with a refund; it is the first and last time I will ever shop here."
"Communication was a little complicated. Shipping prices are extremely high compared to all the other sites Aliexpress, DHGate, TEMU etc."
Above all my expectations
Great App
"This platform has no customer service, if you have an issue with your order forget about cause you will find no one to help you. They have a stupid robot telling you ask your question in English while you texting English.  "
Hi alibaba team it s great application continue doing good work
"easy way to find suppliers, the excellent help to be able to communicate despite not knowing several languages  and excellent trade assurance"
"First time I use Alibaba for shopping I thought it wasn't real, but when my parcel arrived I was more than happy. I bought few things for a try am now geard for more."
True to product
I have had many very good experiences and response from most factoryies I have worked with. Like with everything else we had A few were bad experiences but for the most part it it great.
Helps with ongoing businesses but be careful some suppliers aren t all great most are check for reviews
Was able to buy exactly what I wanted at a great price. Delivery was organised by the supplier making the whole process very simple. Happy that a sample was available before committing to a bigger order
Hard to checkout
Its not a big order but will they deliver for what i paid that they showed me in app or they will deliver something else should i or not u tell?
Quick and reliable. Sean Gao is good.
"Alibaba.com has been Great in the past as well as a week ago to purchase from. I have not had ANY Problems buying from or through Alibaba.com including the Hand Made scissors I just received. Am sure Alibaba.com will give Amazon.com a run for their money. Thank you, Big Time for the purchase Alibaba."
they provide good service and are improving...the products were much better packaged than before...a real improvement
Fast action of order
This company has great customer service and products. I wanted a product that I could customize and they helped me find that. The packaging is so amazing and really protects the products.
"Love the products you sell.  Your service is fast and efficient !!  Seams to be truthful with integrity!!!  I really appreciate it. Especially since our current president is so dishonest and lies constantly.  Truly and sincerely with best regards, Darren Ventura."
All the brands are fake. the size is different from  USA. And the quantity and finishing is bad. that why I don t like buy from this app
"This app is crap. Anything I search never comes up, yet the same thing I was looking for shows up in a search that has nothing to even do with it."
I have just opened your app looking forward to getting products for my new business . 
"Fast, friendly, reliable service. Delivery on time. Product as described."
I easily found a company able to provide the scarves I required. The company provided an excellent product with prompt despatch and excellent communications. Will certainly use again.
Very good apps
Great app great prices
My son bought 10 pieces took awhile but understood got here in good shape product looks good
"Wonderful first time experience. I was extremely hesitant to use Alibaba with such a long wait time, but it worked out well for me."
My app is no longer displaying pics. Everything shows up blank. It s only after i click a blank it pops up but not being able to view and scroll is just so inconvenient.
"I tried many times, this app never allow me login to make purchase on USA."
"I write this with all due respect for what this app already does. 

I don t need to be shown the 5,000 other items that kinda sorta match what I m looking for. Plastic is not wood. Metal is not fabric. An item that can fit inside a box is not necessarily a box. 

I also don t like the section swaps when trying to read through descriptions, which are WAY too small for a mobile app. I d like to be able to see the scroll just scroll, not make a jump to the next section. It s sometimes difficult to read the writing at the bottom on the page but when I try to move it up I m just jumped to the next section. 

Just a few more tweaks and this would be great."
Did you ever want somebody from some other country to tell you that they have something to sell you but when you send them payment you will never hear from them again? Look no more! The people from all over the world being there at one country and saying they are in another and forgetting their lies and telling you a sequence of different things are all on alibaba and would love you to send some bitcoin!
Doing business with Chinese sellers through Alibaba for over a year now. Satisfied with the service. Thanks
"One time I was placing an order and never went thru,they were asking for something....about a number,like 20 times. Until I gave up."
Best ali baba
"My product looked great, and I'm very pleased with the end results."
"Most prices advertised are not what you pay, always much higher."
I was excited and gonna download. I seen a lot of things I wanted to buy. But the reviews on top of unsatisfied customers def turned me away. I don t want and need that headache. Thank you for saving me. Signed someone who actually reads  
When you allow people to put pictures of multiple items up and not make it clear what exactly they are selling and for what price we call that false advertising in America.
The site just steals your money they re scammers con artist Chinese all stick together stay away believe me they will take your money and that supply of goods or you ll get very faulty goods and they will not have your back their trade insurance is a joke they do not honor it or any of their other rules they are all ploys to scam you bait  and switching you
"Alibaba does offer great deals, but if things go wrong with a product there is almost no way of getting it sorted out"
Excellent customer relations from my vendor VANILLA Great service was done super fast and my customer was super happy the product was better than I expected I would definitely order more from this vendor
Basically asked for shipping fee for more than 3 days and still did not get what I asked.
varaity of options of products and delivery methods. competitive prices.
"To get information about a product it s like playing a waiting game. You have to email the owner they take forever to get back to you. They never emailed you a price. You don t know the shipping. For once can someone go onto your site. See something they want, and buy it. Your site is too complicated. business time is money"
"It seems very good for business people 
But the ordering process need to be upgrade"
It is difficult the purchase the required product observing the tedious procedure of filling up the documents. Please make it simple so that illiterates like me can also place the orders.
Very satisfied regarding production and quality...
Good quality. Fast shipping.
Very difficult getting in touch with suppliers who actually listen to my needs. Can t find anyone who will customize what I want
"I cannot find my history of purchase and Chads on my phone but I can see it on my computer 
I have erased the app and loaded it again but that didn t work SO what do I do now"
i LOVE this app. it s definitely a great tool. but my messenger isn t working at the moment and i don t know why. please fix this ASAP so i can get in contact with my vendors.
"Your website show a bunch of shirts, but no inventor"
"I almost gave up on Alibaba altogether because I felt that so many people were trying to scam me. Please refer to the review that I submitted. (There's one thing I forgot to mention #8 Red Flag- Usually these people had deals which were too good to be true. Like an 80% discount off of the normal retail price.

Finally I realized that I needed to check off the ""Verified"" and ""Trade Assurance"" boxes to find somebody who was legitimate to deal with"
I need help I don t understand why it says that there are 100 pieces for 1000 for a webcam or controller can you help
all around the people in this planet use this Alibaba app
"We bought a solar panel system ($4 grand) with 25 yr warranty (worthless paper) it was professional installed, and panels ground out after 4 months creating a hazard to human life and property (defective), inverter shuts down and panels started on fire, the seller will not respond to us at all, Alibaba does nothing to help :( and you can not respond to any their emails. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY OR APP, products from this company are defective junk"
Good marketing
Great customer service. The quality of the product is great and packaged well.
"Purchased an item from a reputable seller on Alibaba platform for about $100. Paid by paypal. After the item was paid for the seller contacted me on what'sapp and said I need to pay an additional $30 for shipping. I did not agree and asked for a refund. They wanted me to change the refund reason, to ""buyer change purchase plan"" but the real reason was that seller increased shipping cost. They are not refunding my money, and I have not received the products. I have placed a dispute through Paypal but have to wait to see what happens. Alibaba was absolutely no help."
I love things like that
Great place to start a business
"                                         

I do not recommend dealing with them if you want to get your money back, they deduct an amount on you, and you will not receive the full merchandise, nor can you even take your full money."
Very good app. Has a lot of the Manufacturers needed to start a business
overall it was a good experience with platform transaction. but the Messages sometime didn't show supplier on list even though we spoke to each other and had order placed.
I love this website they have such a variety of products with ease of use and great quality.
The best app for any purchase
"User friendly, competitive rates, great customer service.

I m a fan!"
Makes ordering very easy. Fast response with vendors. Secure.
1ST ORDER AND IM VERY SATISFIED. THANK YOU EXCELLENT SERVICE.
It is Not always easy to get used to the surface of alibaba; but if the order is placed everything was ok
"This is a great idea
Makes things easier
First time trail seems to be exactly what I need"
Good categories and an extensive layer of products.
Very nice this app is put in the app
Is your stuff insured. I live n Harlingen Texas n my brother never received his package n he requested a signature  to receive package it said package was delivered how is that possible if he didn t sighn for it SMH
"Got my money back after the shipping company delayed my order and didn t handle the paperwork sent probably with customs. The shipment got returned, and the seller didn t want to refund me anything, not a single dollar. But the dispute team refunded the whole amount. What a fair and great app"
"The supplier is professional with great communication and a pleasure to deal with. The supplier made the transaction seamless, smooth and easy with no problems. The product I purchased is clean and very well constructed. I rate the product 9/10. I would give a 10 but the supplier did not provide instructions or the rubber isolators for the muffler/tailpipe hangers. Overall, a great experience."
"I found many phones which is fake, now I am thinking that everything is fake in this website. I cannot buy due to this issue.
I hope to solve this problem."
"In particular, OLGALI's employees are highly recommended. So kind and the best employee. It's the best of all the Chinese employees I know. I was lucky in my life to meet this employee. I highly recommend it to you. I want to go all the way to China and meet them. This employee is making China happy!"
"Trusted site and sellers, great communication. Fast transaction and delivery, top quality products. Highly recommended."
"GREAT QUALITY PRODUCTS, GREAT SUPPLIER, FAST DELIVERY. RECOMMENDED +++++"
"Alibaba always looks for a way to help sellers and not customers, we open a dispute and 4 months later still no solution, alibaba personel won't answer on time, and even when evidence is provided, they will look for other ways ,so you will get cheated. When they know they will loose or when ypu prove you are right, they try to bribe you so you won't take legal action. Worst experience ever"
Alibaba is awesome. I am glad I found it
"The company is a great addition to the supply chain. I was missing a product and they expressed me the items from the original manufacturer within a day i believe it was. quick, honest, friendly, and quality service."
"I am new to the website Alibaba, and I was terrified to make a purchase, but the executive was really helpful, I would be even more glad if she could understand my language better. But anyhow Alibaba made it simple for me and I loved the service she provided me. It was quick and the product quality is just super excellent. I am glad I found this company on this platform. Now I am rest assure that I am going to do really well in my business and help my people with aesthetic fashion!"
"Delivered as promised. Printer very good professional quality, affordable price and easy to install. Eva is very helpfull and quick answers on questions :) thanx!"
"Hi, I m checking to find out how you start selling product and be consistent. Please and thank"
The great

i had very friendly communication.. best customer service!!
Working with Thor from Shenzhen Fly is great. Customer Service is A1
User friendly
"Excellent products, very good service, on time shipping, sharp good communication and willing to resolve issues.

What else can a customer ask for?"
"Yet to place a order. But from the experience of someone who is not as internet savvy. The website and help service is user friendly and prices are far beyond its competitors. More importantly the brand has world wide reputation that s been labeled 5 stars and meets all those expectations. Looking forward to a lasting business relationship with this company in these times of imitation, sale first, and culture outdated concepts and missions.

We Thank You

"the most trusted app ever 

Simple and easy thank you Ali baba  "
"I was quoted a price and then when I was going to place the order for the Balance of my customers Holders, the price was increased. I had already quoted these to my customer and I will not go back on my quote. So I will find another supplier, for these Holders, who's business practices are not underhanded!"
I have had problems ever since placing an order on Nov 13th that I never did receive. Hopefully my phone getting hacked and my personal information being exposed 34X are unrelated. Tried contacting seller a few times about order just to find today after entering tracking number. Package was never sent and since app updated it now shows no purchases. Thank god PayPal refunded my money with no questions.
I had a little difficulty navigating the site.  Dimensions of products were difficult to find.  I could not enlarge the fabrics to see what I like.
Interesting site that has everything in the world
Highly recommended to use and installed it..
"Alibaba another way of doing business, it was very exciting.
The support was very good, good tracking of the order. The sustained attention in the search for suppliers and the security of payments are elements that mark the quality of the system.

Doing business on Alibaba is an amazing way to do business."
The products were all intact and there were additional items added without any payment from me. Great service...
"very fast , all type of qualities , flexable vendors"
"The worst experience I have ever had in my whole life, ordered 3 times through Alibaba and the orders never got shipped out form china. I asked for a refund and they are taking 10 years to process and finalize the refund. They try their best to keep the orders but they do nothing to fasten the shipping times. They really wasted my time ordering from them. I WOULD NEVER ORDER ANYTHING FORM THIS APP."
"Amazing product variations on the Alibaba platform. Reliable factories with great communication skills, especially the companies with the grade ""verified"".
I like Alibaba a lot!"
"I tried to buy many things  but the delivery cost is never clear
I try to communicate with the staff but it takes long for them to answer back Like me there is a lot of contractors that are trying to buy many tools many items but it s hard to communicate with you guys"
"This app is very easy to use and navigate. There's plenty of sellers on the site that will give you multiple offers. It a great tool for my needs,"

This company was helpful and shipped my items quickly. I enjoyed a very good experience with them.

"Great Experience with the Seller from Shantou City Chenghai District Letian Craft Trade Firm
on Alibaba!
Ordered a CADA Building Block Kit, came in its original box, Free shipping with Tracking. Shipping can take a while! At the time of ordering a shipment arrival time-frame is given. In my case it took 29 days (water way). No problem with that as it was well within the shipping time frame!
Great Price as well.
Highly Recommend."
I got a name from your site. I was so sure that because it came from you that it was good but I got rip off . Pay for 2 of the 4x4 and to date no response . So this site cost me a lot of money
After a few updates this app is looking and working completely different from older versions.
"Very good quality product, exactly as advertised. Excellent service from Jason. Shipping on time. We are happy"
Too disappointed   as they charge too much for shipping ....waste of time for searching products and stepping back because of shipping price... 15$ just for shipping
I love this app
Great Service Great Product easy communication and fast delivery
Manufacturers stole my business designs and products. Once we contacted them they then made an Instagram and started to attack my business and my followers. They then threatened to steal everything we make from now on. Now they are stalking our account and mass producing all of our designs and products.
"I was fortunate to find a seller that has been extremely kind and helpful! The product cost is perfect for a start-up business, and the product quality is fantastic. I am very impressed with their business practices and how quick the shipping can be! It really depends on the seller. My main seller ships within a couple of days, and the product arrives at my door in roughly a week and a half. They have been kind enough to send me free product samples as well! I very much recommend Alibaba and its affiliates for those who are starting up a business!"
Full of varieties
"The person in charge of e-commerce responded sincerely and promptly to even the smallest of requests.
The quality of the cable assembly I received is accurate and excellent."
"I just started using this app a few days ago and this is by far one of the most professional, but still user friendly apps I ve ever seen. It s easy to get in contact with suppliers and so easy to find exactly what you re looking for."
"I ordered 100 Silicon watches. I was asked by JENNY XIONG what colours. Well sadly I did NOT get the RED, BROWN and WHITE I asked for. When I queried why the mistake I was given so many stories and excuses. First excuse : They don t have the above colours (WHY ask what colours ?) 2nd Excuse was I was sent the correct QUANTITY. I tried to sort my order but talking to JENNY XIONG is like going in circles. I do believe that she knew what she was doing but they don t care as the company know that once you order and pay the hefty COURIER cost that there will be no way you can return the order as you will be paying again. I feel I was misled by the company as well as JENNY XIONG. I will most certainly not be dealing with JENNY XIONG nor this company.  June"
"High quality product, I recommend it."
Useful app
Amazing prices fast shipping. What else can you ask for.
If it's not in Malaysian currency then don't launch it in Malaysia...........
"I love this app, this is the best app you can used to find suppliers for your business."
I try to but something and it says payment failed due to security reason  apply for an appeal  and when I try to do an appeal the box that I have to fill out to submit it doesn t even have anything that I can click on so I cannot submit the appeal. I tried almost every payment method they allowed it doesn t work. Alibaba please fix this.
"They were very helpful with understanding the process, advising us on artwork, and delivering the items on time."
Really nice tool to get any product from the manufacturer
As soon as you install this app it wants to connect to devices on your network. There s no good reason for that. Suspicious!
I have been dealing with this Company for years starting 2008very go experience.
Nice application  
nice one
"Dear Sir:
Please help find Brazil Sour Honey that cures Cancer.  I sent an inquiry to Supplier hoping that this Organic Sour Honey is from Brazil.
Thank You,

Not what i was expecting
Search is easy to use!
"delivery was the best part of this service, im disappointed with my order."
I am interested in buying the portable storage houses they have but it says you have to buy a minimum amount and I only need one I am trying to build a house of grid and was recommended this app but it s seems this is mostly bulk sell unless each unit is like a part or something I am very confused
Makes sounds even when all turned off. Totally disruptive and invasive.
It was perfect seller with excellent product. Advertising exactly what they are selling. Very good communication and excellent product.
Had great experiences with this company so far. Looking forward to continue using them in the future.
Like the ability to interact directly with suppliers ! I also enjoy the option that if suppliers doesn t answer within 24 hours the app suggests other suppliers !
Very helpful with all the information that is needed
I like this app
Always find AliBaba fruitful Source for making business deal with top manufacturing firms
"I love to have all of these manufacturing options at my fingertips, I feel closer to my dreams with each connection. My only issues are the communication time gap , the shipping prices and the shipping time. I have a order now that I have been waiting. Couple of weeks for and I have some orders that come faster than what I thought"
"The furniture is of outstanding quality, great product made of valuable material, spotless, and very beautiful. Shipment arrived in the US without any problems or dents, perfectly packaged. We are extremely happy with the products and the customer service from Dongguan Furniture."
"I purchased some venue decorations items worth almost  12,000, just to warn others on alibaba, the seller I guess is trying to scam me by not delivering since last year November up till now, seller uploaded fake shipping details saying I received my orders, alibaba is not helping as they keep asking for evidence I'd provided several times, I had to contact PayPal and my bank, we are still on it, but I think its more of an organised crime on alibaba side, even my bank told me I've waited too long but I guess seller was deliberately buy time by telling different stories all the time."
"So far I had all good experiences,alibaba has been very reliable."
"Everytime I receive a message from a vendor I try to go to chats via the app and it says loading .
It never loads, so I have to use the website."
thief dogs alibab these scammers They charged 13.93 euro cents for the transaction so I can cancel the order. so they get rich in this swkil stealing people's money by stealing dirty chinese
The only thing missing it shipping cost to analyze true costs
"It's a great apps for those who are doing business and searching for suppliers. But there are a few thing that need to be fix. First is when I search for product, and when I click on the ""Refine"" button the apps crashed/closed. Next is when I'm browsing, the price keeps on going back to USD althought I've set the setting to MYR. Please fix this, thank you so much "
5 stars
"Easy to order from Shenyang Niuxitaier Musical Instrument Co., Ltd. Doris was wonderful. I'll order more when the time comes. Singing bowls were perfect pitch, wonderfully built and shipped in some of the best packing boxes Ive ever seen in my entire life. Doris made the bowls exactly what I wanted. I chose the speed of shipping and it took about a month because I'm cheap! I choose not to ship any faster because it's expensive! Doris cant control the cost nor the time it takes to make its way to the US. The bowls arrived via UPS here in the US."
"This is my first experience with this company, was told they are fair and easy to work with. I am interested in purchasing a paddle boat."
keep the quality stone and dependable carving job.
"This is a bad trick to make your customers keep opening the app. I try to respond to to my chat messages but 90% of the time, there are no messages, just promotions. 

This wastes my time and makes me stop opening the app which creates a bad experience and delays for chat.

Stop being greedy with promotions. People know what they want and they certainly don t like to be tricked and have their time wasted."
Amazing and simple  
Easy and fun to communicate and order products from people all over the world.
"It was my first time using Alibaba to search for manufacturer. It's easy to use, intuitive and loads of different options to make payment. Having application installed on smartphone you will not miss any notifications with messages from sellers. Great tool!"
Exciting business. Model
So far so good
"I love this app,it is the best tecnic and it has the best service  LINDA   thank you!"
"Excellent attention from the sellers, I found everything I looked for and more."
Another great purchase through Alibaba! Great customer service before ordering and very quick shipment.
So far I am enjoying the app! I especially like the fact that the content is streamlined and everything works!!!
I need car tape full option usb Mobil to tape
"Good customer service, quality products"
It s worse app they don t respond to you fast and there is no way to make a payment for any products you want to buy it s sh***t
"I cannot be more happy with Jason Deng at Dongguan City Xiong Fei Electric Material Co., Ltd. he is an awesome proffesional, always helping and giving good advices even if you are quite noob on this kind of issues. The quality of the product and the results are better than spected, and i am working with them for a couple of months.
the best company and best seller for creators"
"Description:
Alibaba is not supporting to get my refund even after many dispute application. Simply said wait wait wait... Already waited more than 140days instead of 45 to 60 days of normal delivery time. Already more than Enough time given to the freight forwarder. Actual delivery date is feb 9th. But not delivered. Then time extended to march 4th. At that time also not delivered. Agent committed last and final date to march 24th. Here also not delivered. Now march 28th. Every time they give fake promise only. Alibaba will lost its reputation due to fake suppliers like this...."
"I use this app regularly. Love it. Am 100% satisfied. I save a good amount of time and money. I am a real user, my shop is in Texarkana Texas."
I order a products  then I cancel it right away because I change my mind seller still not refunding my money neither sending me a product
The trade assurance is a must have to protect money. Good company always fast immediately there for customers.
"I ve been struggling for many days, in trying to make an account and log in to their website on a desktop. Their app is INFINITELY more efficient and faster. Save yourself the aggravation and just use the app."
"Nothing bad to say about the company,
customer service was great the product is very good, quality great"
I m just love this website so much choice. go to process I love it love it love it. thank you for this website this product it s help us a lot.
willing to help and clearly explained even though many question i have asked is the same
It s helpful find items to makes
Love this cute just wish shipping wasn t so high priced
"Misleading advertisement, no seller meets the advertised price, announce a minimum order of 500 pieces in the amount between $ 1.00 to 1.30 when you count thousand pieces the value is $ 5.00 dollars this is ridiculous not recommend."
"Alibaba is not helping me with the seller not shipping according to the agreement. Alibaba agent Ellie is cooperating on the sellers behalf, and is only taking the sellers side. Ellie keeps pushing the case date with the same response. I have done a lot of buisness on alibaba because of the feeling of the safeness of dealing on alibaba. If this case dont get sorted i will not ever use alibaba as my chinease connection platform.

I am uploading all evidence of supplier shipping on diffrent date as agreed, and goods not arriving before the agreed guarentee arrival date. The alibaba agent says goods arrived before 5x times even though i proved the opposite. Ellie is for no help and have through the case that has been going on for over a month still not called me to find a solution.

Dont matter to use Alibaba for anything else than to find the contact for the supplier. You have no protection when it comes to the end even though you are paying for the service.

I DO NOT RECCOMEND DOING BUISNESS THROUGH ALIBABA. They are pushing out the cases, and supplier has still not shipped batteries for the goods close to 2 months after Agreed delevery date. DO NOT RECCOMEND. Find a agent in china that can do the contact with supplier to be safe, alibaba is not as safe place to do buisess!

Be aware of the suppliers making fake evidence to make it look like they are in the right, and (ALIBABA AGENT) Knows.

BE CAREFULL!"
"Their prices are twice higher than the U.S. I downloaded the app try to get some products from them and save a little money because they deliver from China and China s products are cheaper than the U.S.,but the prices shows on the app of each items is incorrect if you tryna buy something they told you a different price not the one it shows in the app. I was tryna order a coffee table and the price was $599 after I try to chat one of their agent she told me the price is $900 and I said like what it saying $599 in the app. She was really rude she didn t even answer me, I try to text her again to make sure the price but I couldn t send her message because she blocked me. 
Once again things that comes from China are 10 times cheaper than the Unites States. I know because I been there. But on this app they are twice expensive than the U.S..."
"I used to have landscape mode for alibaba for ipad which was a life saver for me, but now it s always static on portrait mode, which is bad when I need to type with the physical keyboard. On top of that, the Alibaba chat is not working as well. Strangely I ve already deleted and reinstalled the app multiple times thinking it was something with my iPad but it cannot be as Alibaba is the only app where this happens. Very frustrating."
"Qulity product, Awesome service, Fast delivery!
This blinds are top notch! Very elegant design and very modern look.
Product is not cheap, the materials used have lots of quality and are very durable.
Placed the order on June 5 and Received it on June 12.
Second time buying from this seller and again, I had a great experience.
Great job Zhejiang Muxuan Home Furnishing Co., Ltd.
Thank you Rena, you're awesome!"
Love this app & can t wait to buy something!
"Simple and user-friendly 
Trust market"
"If I could give this app zero stars, I would. No matter how careful you are on this site, there s just so many scammers on here. I bought my first (and definitely the last) order on here, and the seller sent me the wrong item. Wouldn t refund me, and told me to just keep what I had. Extremely negative experience."
"Would like to have 5 units in this plant
What is the price + shipment to USA Florida"
under charged me for shipping and still gave me a good deal. thank you
"I was hesitate for a long time to give a try for once for a self-order, but under real professional conditions I was asked by employer to make a huge order for the company, I was surprised how it is easy to search and select industries by thier rates and certificates, it was easy to communicate easy to reslove issues and delivered on time. just take your time to look around and understand the website if it is your first experince."
The videos are top quality
"Quality, professionalism, and great service!"
We had a negative experience as the incorrect part was sent (not the part number agreed to) however Alibaba did not support the customer or provide protection through Trade Assurance. Alibaba continuously noted that nothing could be done to compel the seller to refund. We returned the part internationally funding the return shipping which has been a costly and lengthy endeavor. The seller has also not been cooperative in clearing the import/receiving the return which Alibaba also has not intervened in. The overall experience has been of a lack of customer support from Alibaba to correct the fraudulent business dealings of the seller.
Just recently purchase an electric folding bike here from Alibaba. I ve always been using Amazon but I saw it in Alibaba that was offering a better price that was way cheaper than buying it from Amazon. So I decided to buy it from Alibaba instead. My experience has been wonderful the customer service is nothing short than great. It only took them to sent the product to my front door in 4 days that is amazing. The product works like a charm and I m loving my e-bike. It s called Coswheel definitely would buy it again from Alibaba. It s going to be a blast buying it from here. Thank you from Malaysia
"I love this app , i found everything im looking for but most of the items sell by package. This is a really great app to Businesses tho."
"id like to say and report cause i already do the report at customer service alibaba , but no respon .. please alibaba remove scam at alibaba , so many scam give a promo buy 2 free 1 , buy 5 free 2 and wanted to make a deal at whatsapp and make a payment by western union , moneygram and bitcoin only , if buyer make a payment by trade assurance , the seller will avoid buyer .. please alibaba do something about this concern , if someone a newbie wanted to make purchase at alibaba and they dont know about this , they will be a scam ."
"Trust, quality and product. The Alibaba website still sucks but the merchants make up for it."
Please update app not everyone lives in China. I tried to use klarna and can t because I don t understand the language . And this app is hard to direct also .
Ask total of item each then ask shipping rates then add total & divide it by the quantity majority of time shipping is a lot more and instead of paying 5 for the item I ll be paying 12-16 dollars then to bump it up and sell it retail theirs no profit Alibaba knows we re reselling so their bumping wholesale prices & we re loosing. They need to be more organized & honest.
Really good people really nice my orders always good and my order comes fast to I will be ordering my hair from them next time
"The company where the product was purchased is great in everyway. The product that was displayed by Alibaba is the issue. The lights are very difficult to set up, they are not sound sensitive. The lights are not as bright and they are blurry not a sharp light."
GOOD bigness side
Best app otp
Not be installed to my phone
"Despite the language problem (Spanish-English), and my lack of experience on the platform, the seller was very helpful in solving technical and logistical problems."
"On IPad (pro), Alibaba website forces you to download the app. You cannot use the site otherwise. The app is buggy, and non-logical. Many features do not work smoothly, and when you try to open a company to review their products after starting to chat with them, it does not work properly. Please allow us to just use the normal desktop site on iPad."
"I ordered 200 handbags and paid full amount in US dollars. Guess what I received in mail? A small keyring and cherry on top, the company blocked me on WhatsApp and on alibaba page. They are still fooling people. I dont think if I can ever trust anyone on alibab again. Worst company ever. I suggest don t ever buy anything on alibaba or pay anyone there. I d rather pay a higher price and buy something authentic locally then trusting these Chinese!"
Great app easy to use / efficien t Now lets make millions of people happy with our services !!
I feel protected buying from them.  I have received everything I have ordered
This is the best site for very high quality and amazing low prices from honest and trustworthy sellers. Fast deliveries.   I am a repeat buyer.
"Received the order, I bought all the designs & will order again soon. Good supplier"
When I search something with this latest update the search results don t show up so basically I can t search
We get the product we ordered and on time.
"I did 2 orders with that supplier. They work both times to be perfect and to give a 200% in all (quality, design, delivery, quality etc....) to make their customers happy. And they are doing well. I hardly recommend Gitra as your supplier."
"committed to the purchase, security in the purchase"
good
Very Good Apps
"Hello dear admins and workers like me and us,i m so thankful for your powerful application and your wonderful system,mainly all of the beauties is for dear men dear Couch AliBaba  "
They checked in with me via internet to guide the process of my order. Very good.
It s a great site with finding some great things to resale but sometimes the vendors do not provide accurate information in regards to their products. You have to be very careful who you purchase from no matter how great the reviews are.
excelent
Won t find better prices!!!
Product is good but shipping was unacceptable. Four months to receive the product.
Great apps!!! Many things to view!!!
I love alibaba thank you to suppliers and shippers. Well done.
"This app is nice. However, the app has too many junk notifications that cannot be turned off in the settings panel of the app. So you can either turn off all notifications and potentially miss an important message from a contact, or you have to constantly sift through and mark junk notifications as read to clear them. You can also assume all notifications are junk, which gives a bad impression of foreign suppliers that are trying their best to be professional and establish business relationships. 
It appears the app developers keep adding new features or feeds that do not have a corresponding control switch in the settings panel.  
Long story short this app could do a better job of helping all clients separate the wheat from the chaff.  Other than that, a good resource and tool."
Dispute system is bias toward seller.  Alibaba protects sellers.  Buyers have very limited ability to dispute.   Some sellers cheat and sell you garbage.  You can really return and get refund because shipping is so expensive.
great deal from supplier
"This app offers so much for the consumer, excellent quality products."
loved this simple process to deal with business supplier and trust point of refund if anything goes wrong with product
Please don t buy from here. Bought items from one of their sellers and received different items and some never showed. Filled a complaint and Alibaba supported the sellers bait and switch. No refund
"I love the product (electric bath chair for the disabled people) and the top of the line service.

The delivery was fast, with costumer assistance via WhatsApp and email, I love the experience and the chair is awesome.

I recommend the chair for all the people with motor impairment."
Ready to see my merchandise thanks  really happy and looking forward to this app
Good place for aftermarket products
It s very difficult to just click and purchase. The image is different from the color explanations that they have. For example you will see a table exactly like u want it in the image but then if u click the choice of color....they will offer white. But you want polished stainless steel? So then u wonder if it s legit.
"I had a very pleasant experience, I like the serious approach that is being applied."
"Working with the sales rep Ms chunjin zhan was excellent from start to finish. I didn't have any problem during the collaboration period. The most optimal solutions and the lowest price were sought. Delivery was ok. But we are not talking about the transporter, but only the representative of the mige company... it is difficult to find people as well qualified, patient and helpful."
Great quality and design. I was surprised with it and it came before the delivery date. I am super happy with everything and would be ordering more in the near future.
Alibaba managed my order exceptionally well.
This site is too hard to figure out. How do you add stuff to your cart?
The user interface makes this app unbearable to use. Everything is gigantic and there is no way to resize the resolution to make browsing more comfortable.
"So about a week A go i received product that was poorly made and i asked for a partial refund since on the way i had 300 pcs missing and 138 damaged they failed to help me . Never use kabagge to pay only pay with bank card if product is damaged that way you can claim.
They didnt help me whats so ever be cautious. And beware check your product right away ."
"Easy inquiry process, thank you"
"excellent quality, Watson is great in understanding and making easy from drawing/reverse engineering to LL THE WAY TO SHIPPING MAKES IT A BREEZE.."
so far it is a nice site just starting to order so i am not sure if the price is as listed or in the range plan on adding to my store selection to increase sales think this site will help me reach my next goal
"They took it sold me product for their country Not as they promised for the USA!!!
They cheated me. Beware."
Just amazing.
Still new here haven t figured out how to purchase yet
"Been trying to log in, it won t let me !!"
Everything is not where it s supposed to be. Terrible thing to do. Please stop changing app and making it more difficult to do business
"The app/website is very confusing and not organized. I don t get notifications accurately when suing or not using the app unless I m on the main page. 
Transportation companies are the king. They decide whatever price they want. Vary too much among different companies."
Many products to choose from
"The communication, the shipping and the quality. Everything is good. The best supplier!"
As I live in Australia I was nervous about purchasing items direct from China and I have found the experience easier and quicker than expected. Communications with the manufacturing company and the price including shipping was excellent
Very smooth and reliable. The messenger section is a bit complicated though. Would add one more star if the message system is fixed.
"How could I check the customer experiences about a particular items??
When I need to buy anything I need to know the customers opinions about it  
Or tell me how?"
"Got many things from alibaba 
Most orders are fast had couple take over a month 
Gotta do your research and chat with the supplier for the best deals"
Favorites are not showing up
"My experience has been good so far, but I have left a space for any improvement."
"I'm a fairly new buyer to Alibaba,
Any questions or concerning I have regarding my orders are quickly and efficiently answered.
Navigating the websites can be challenging for a new comers.
Trust me I make a lot of mistakes, I'm sure the sellers look at some of my Request's and say ""What is he thinking"" or ""What is he trying to say"". But I'm getting better and they are SO patient, Its not the end of the world... It was just a typing mistake! Mistakes are learning and learning is the best part of life... There are unbelievably great deals here. This website has changed my life and it can change yours Too.... Just take a deep breath.... Get a cup of coffee... And don't be afraid to ask lots of questions... Now let's go make money... Best of Luck ... Carroll ...USA"
"Fast, easy and secure transaction couldn't ask for any better"
Why not buying directly from the alibaba app?
Been waiting over 2 months for a refund response. The people on chat just say they re going to escalate. Then I don t hear anything back. 2 months is crazy to keep hearing  ok I will escalate   every 1-3 days. They don t care about the customer.
"You make this site hard to get information concerning products I am interested in.
I could want to buy one or more products or be a dealer. You try to force us to give information I am not ready to give until I make decisions!"
"first thing this app asks is to gather your other network devices
then when you log in with google it mislabels itself as a MAC"
Been great
"Hi my name is Diamond I ve been looking and searching for a way and here it is in my lap God is good!!!! You guys are awesome I just want to be successful, I have so many bright ideas coming soon thank you."
Best online shopping link in the world even tho I just bought 1 item from them.. 
Amazing price a d quality
If I could give this app one star I would! Even if you report a vendor for selling false goods nothing happens! I waited a whole week and a half before my refund determination became final and you want to know how much I got back after submitting PROOF of the false items sent to me? $10!!!!!! The Alibaba rep lied and said they would give me an extra $50 for compensation when I spent $116 on the purchase in total! A total waste. I ll be deleting this app and I hope someone reports them for allowing scammers to CONTINUE selling on their site!!!!
good idea
Buying from Alibaba is much easier than I expected. The only problem is some companies do not respond when you place an actual order forcing you to cancel and start all over again. (SHRUGS).... Can t wait to receive my first delivery and see the reactions of my customers! Thanks Alibaba
This site and app makes it possible to make decent living by trading.
"Everything process from start to finish went well.
Regina Qin kept me updated until delivered."
"This supplier is very honest and reliable,I can trust them to do a long time business!"
"Alibaba Trade Assurance is not working. We ordered samples from the supplier's UK based warehouse. Samples were ok so we placed a big order from China. The products from China were lower quality (unusable) and I asked to return them for a refund. We proposed several ways including returning the products, on our cost, to UK warehouse where they can resell them. The supplier didn't want to hear about a return and Trade Assurance team did everything they could to protect the supplier. In the end they pressured me to take a partial refund and keep the products which I couldn't use.

My experience with Aliaba :
1 - Trade Assurance is not working !
2 - Suppliers will never take responsibility for their mistakes and they do everything they can to make you keep the product you are not happy with."
"We bought goods through Ali Baba site from China and the chinies company fraudulently took money from us and sent out faulty goods, we raised a dispute with Ali Baba but the seller refused to refund and Ali Baba also refused despite given proof of the faulty goods.

can anyone help how to get our money back from Ali Baba who guaranteed, and the seller?"
I'm really excited to start my new business and this website definitely has everything I need to move forward. Everything was easy to find and I look forward to doing business in the near future.
Best deals. time depends on sellers and reviews help to find the best seller.
Wish I can buy what I need not in Bulk  
"Too many spam crooks not like dh gate. Hard to find golf manufacturers that will send products for startup  Need for detail help with verifiable manufacturers when dealing ent with us bankers for finances- I ask for free samples for quality controls, I will only deal with companies that can supply everything free upfront. Looking for real leather golf shoes & golf gloves, golf clubs design, 100% polyester breathable golf shirts , wind shirts, jackets,& socks, real leather or exotic belts never pu  - frustrating lost money getting nothing mailed in return!"
The company has always treated my orders with professionalism
"I was attended by Zhou Jiacheng, he s incredible Profesional and Fast, ready to suggest many options and very good alternatives. He is disposal to attend whit integrity and a high level of energy, I was going to shop some pieces and he showed me a great variety of things you sell, that I felt in love of them and I ordered those alternatives too.
Thank you very much Zhou, my Pleasure to deal with you in the other part of the world.
Sincerely,
Rita
Mexico City"
I absolutely love this site.
There s a lady on IG who screenshot your brand items and she s selling it very expensive to people who don t know she s get the items from your website. That s a misleading and scamming for I m reporting her it need to be stopped.
Makes it easier as an entrepreneur
"First it was no response, now it a clearance proble tht I had nothing to do with. I told the seller when all this was happening I wanted my money back!!! I was charged 145$ and on the custom paper the product was only worth 25$ !!!! Like seriously"
"My first time purchasing on Alibaba and it was a great experience. The supplier I chose was super friendly, quick in her replies and very professional.
A lot of negative reviews about Alibaba but mine was the exact opposite. You just need to ensure you choose the right (and VERIFIED) supplier to avoid scams and disappointments."
"THEY PROTECT SELLERS THAT SCAM!

Be aware, don't pay any deposits before seeing the product as you will be sent crap and then the money is taken away as Alibaba protects the seller, not the customer. Buy with credit cards as they will keep all your money even if you have all evidence and rights in the world."
Great!! !!!!!!!!!!
Always quick to respond. Great customer service. Products are top notch.
"The message system is terrible. 

It is all over the place and complicated. 

Keep it simple."
"The sellers advertise ""Low Minimum Order Quantity"" to attract buyers but when you submit an inquiry, you quickly find out their required MOQ is not even close to whats advertised. Had many bad experiences on alibaba."
Too many things to see before i can order
Everyone I ve dealt with in Alibaba. seemed very nice kind and honest people. Very professional thank you
Lack of assurance to the costumer that received defective items feels like there's no warranty. Just really disappointing.
I'm very satisfied with the quality of the bags and the printed logo. They were produced to my exact specifications and shipped quickly!
"excellent quality, as promised"
Sometimes sellers respond quickly and other times slow. But over all have found many things I could not imagine existed.
"I m very happy with this app that it has to offer here I m still searching thru to see what I m interested in.
   It s an amazing Application!:)"
I have yet to be able to complete a transaction. I sent all of my information and was messaging back and forth but never received an invoice or payment details. It s very frustrating!
Explained well as it should be
"When I first made my account it was just for me to purchase clothing for myself but now I use my account for business the vendors are very responsible and respectful, they reply back quickly and when your custom items are shipped it doesn t take long shipping may take up to 2 weeks which is perfect for me. You might come across a few vendors that s doing a bit much but other than that it s a great app"
Nice app. A little left to figure out but pretty good product variety and very good pricing.
This app reminds me of AliExpress every thing is cheap I love it
"I gave one star because shipping costs are outrageous!!! Some shipping costs are more then a double of product price it self, in total for that price I can get better products then on this app..."
"Very good and quick response, I recommend anyone interested in buy to give this market place a shot"
The site is void of serious information.  The consumer wants to know details and shipping if it s from a foreign country. Does the item conform to your country specific infrastructure like 110volt or 220 in Europe. As a buyer we are extremely hesitant to invest any larger amount without the specifics that are tailored to our country and our needs.  I m looking at a tractor but seriously doubt I would buy one since the info is lacking and the possibility of not finding parts makes this type of purchase a projected failure.
This app is the best ever I like everything about it  
"This site is created to steal people's money. $1285 was stolen from me by( Guangzhu Huimei Technology Co,Ltd) and the help center did nothing. I do not recommend dealing with this fake site. I bought a massage machine which worked only for 2 months., be careful from this company, their products are cheap quality"
I love this app. Stuff you can't get from a store front you can get it from this app . I love the way the communicate with you let you know the shipping cost and full amount of the purchase .I love the app it's amazing and I will share this with my friends always ...to the developers this a   good one
"I had an outstanding experience shopping on Alibaba.com. The customer service was excellent, promptly and courteously answering all my questions. I found the company to be highly cooperative, willing to adjust to my requirements and changes. The cost of my purchases was within an acceptable range, leading to a very satisfying buying experience. Overall, I would highly recommend Alibaba.com to anyone looking for high-quality products and exceptional service"
Worst app i have ever used..i tried to use website but it always asked me to open Alibab app. Everything on the app is too big includes words and pictures.
"It is on time, totally satisfied."
Great place to start business
"One of the main things for which I feel very comfortable with the service is the quality of person they have as a sales agent, excellent communication and a lot of honesty in every sense of the word, super fast and responsible shipment for which I obtained the item in excellent time ... Really very comfortable with all your service."
I am super happy with the quality and service I got
"Amazing experience, gently, fast and professional!
Thank you!"
"Alibaba is a great way to hook up with suppliers. However, the app doesn t allow me to organize my  liked  items into categories. Also, when I am discussing a product with a supplier, this will originally appear in the chat. However the product reference disappears, leaving me to read the chat and figure out who is selling what."
"I have sent over $10,000 usd to this company back in November Of 2021.  I have not gotten my entire order and have been out of business due to this lack of parts.  They won t reply to my emails and now Candice Lee is ignoring my messages telling me if I complain she won t help me.   I have been out of work for 6 months with many of my customers complaining to me cause they will not send me the items I paid for.    She refuse to refund me for missing items saying no refund for custom parts.  No parts have been made so a refund should not be a problem.    

This is bad business."
"Great E-commerce service! All Suppliers on Alibaba.com that are not VERIFIED and doesn t have TRADE ASSURANCE, these are the Suppliers you might not wanna do business with."
This app ok but you can t get help that much you have to be super careful buy samples first and take screen shot when you make deals with suppliers most of them they send you scam with quality don t stock like me just advertisement
Find things for cheaper and good quality
There are some really great suppliers here if you do the work to find them.
"The ordering and payment process was professional and easy to follow.
All relevant information was provided quickly and correctly."
Exciting talent of products. Highly recommend using the app.
Everything was very trustworthy and smooth!
"Fast delivery, great product. The manufacturer offers exactly what was required. I plan to continue working with him."
I ordered Tesla screen swivel picked item paid never got confirmation of order took money through no problem never got item couldn t even get through to customer support
"Shipping was great, customer service was great and the product is great."
ease of communication with manufacturer quick delivery
Company went above and beyond to suggest low cost machining methods and suggest different finishes to make the product beter
"Always have to force close the app to fix bug issues. Cant select my orders when I want to view them, multiple broken hyperlinks, etc. Also no real explanation on how to use the app for newcomers. Good when it works but doesn t work 35% of the time. That s a lot."
Still new to using app but overall it s been easy and great !
"When I was sixteen I used to get on the school computers to negotiate imports with the Chinese. Five years later, and how they ve grown. This app brings back glorious memories."
"Took 20 minutes just to get system to log me in. 
Is there a way to make the sign in process easier while still maintaining security?"
"Everything great, with great services from Susan"
My brother told me about your site I am enjoying it to the fullest I have to be careful though I don t want to order everything
First time I've placed few different orders from Alibaba and so far I'm really satisfied with the sellers I've been dealing with. Very nice environment and people really willing to help and serve fully and to satisfy completely to get the best of the items looking for.
"Cherry from SHENZHEN SMART-WAY TECHNOLOGY CO.,LTD is a great professional, and helped us a lot!"
Great quality excellent customer service love this company  winners
"My very first attempt at ordering something from this app cost me hundreds of dollars not only did I not receive the merchandise they refuse to refund me my money because I would not buy more product from them before they sent the order,, to add insult to injury I have yet to find a way to contact Ali Baba to follow complaint or try receive my product or my money"
"This site is so Sad how could you guys let these people rob and steal from people? There still using Alibaba so that still fall back on you guys. People do not send $1 to this site they are Robbing people a friend of mine sent $31,000 for a Electric car they sent him a $1000 golf cart witch was wired wrong. So you been warned the rest is up to you they almost got me but he was my teacher. The price s look good but your not getting what your paying for."
I like this software
"Best trading website you can use 
Recommend to all professional business people"
I enjoyed my purchase will buy again
Nice app
"I like your products , but you don t point out the price for only one item and how much is the the cost of shipping to Morocco .
Thanks"
"The most annoying thing about Alibaba is the sellers. They often list their products with cheap prices to lure you in, then send you the real, expensive ones when you contact them, which is a big time waster if you are looking through many products. The expensive shipping prices are also a deal breaker. Overall, the app works well and there are all kinds of products. But, the sellers are a turn-off."
"I think this app has potential to be my favorite app, but the fact that I can not search by image upload like aliexpress and DHgate makes me use this app almost never. If that s one thing I wish could be improved would be for the developers to create a way for us to search with image uploads."
"Products quality is good even though they sent me different types of products.
Thank you."
Alibaba is an excellent platform for small to large business needs. I love it and recommend to all.
knowledgeable and professionalism
"Every part of the transaction was perfect, items came exactly as described and faster than I anticipated."
Great customer service
A lot of manufactures from China will list a cost for a product. Once you show your interested and place an order they change the cost price to sometime 5x more or the minimum order. I call them out for promoting fake prices and they make excuses like oh we need to update to the new prices ect. This has happened 90% of the time since I ve opened an account two years ago. There have been a few good honest manufacturers and I have been a loyal customer too. But something needs to change cause I m not the only person this happens too sadly all my friends too.
being fairly new Alibaba made it easy once I figured out the process.
"When first placing my order I had learned that the was out of stock, but Mandy went right to work and found another supplier who could supply the triggers and complete my order. This whole experience with Mandy made me feel like I was getting the white glove red carpet treatment. Mandy went out of her way to make sure I was #1.
Mandy is an asset and she is #1 in my book.

Everything was Perfect!!!"
"Good seller is Shantou City Jinhaian Craft & Toy Factory. They were the 1st store I had brought from. I had brought 8 small handbags and shipping was only about $20 bucks, and it took less than a month for me to receive them. I wish they had more stuff for sale. But after then all the other vendors I tried were terrible. Some no longer had the dresses in stock but still have them for sale, for stock poly mailers (not custom mailers) MANY vendors (Yes I do mean more than 3 vendors is doing this) min order of 500 then when I start the order they would respond back saying the min is 5000. And the shipping is crazy expensive. Maybe it s a better site for huge or big business owners. But if you re a tiny or small business then I wouldn t recommend. You ll give yourself a headache dealing with them."
The sales representative was friendly and helpful. The items arrived very quickly and exceeded my expectations. I will definitely be ordering more.
Thank you I am back with Alibaba it s great and secure.
"It is very easy to work with vendors, finding quality products. The process of getting necessary information to make purchasing decisions and placing the orders is very quick.

Products are packed with care and arrive on time in great shape."
"This supplier is the BEST I have dealt with on Alibaba , he doesn't make promises he can't keep , he is honest and always quick to reply to questions and help.
If every seller on Alibaba was as good as Frank , then Amazon wouldn't exist."
be prepaired to be frustrated the customer service on this site is useless only certain credit cards can be used and if u have problems getting verified to bad there is nobody to help if you get error codes it doesnt look like i will be making another purchase on here its a 1 and done website because once u make the first credit purchase ur labeled a criminal by the ali mastas
Bad app with a lot poor quality product ! Never use it again  Don t trust the low price! Not worth it!
"Product was exceptional in quality, and delivered very fast. Delivery was even sooner then expected."
The sales resp are always available to answer any question regarding your order
"I have tried to buy a snow blower and hot tub and the web site is ridiculous! Doesn t make sense I think you only want to work with businesses ! 
You don t talk about the shipping and do you deliver to homes .I just don t know!"
Never be able to get help from a real person. Not be able to pay by credit card.
"I needed a little larger quantity of product (not a huge quantity)for some custom craft work. Alibaba was able to connect me to a manufacturer that was willing to provide the product and quantity I needed. The pricing was straight forward. With shipping, taxes and any duties included, I was still able to save quite a bit over the resellers. Alibaba promised a delivery date and I received my order almost 2 weeks before the promised delivery date. I expect to use Alibaba's services as needed in the future."
the product made it on time. and was guaranteed purchase with trade assurances
It s all about shipping! You don t improve your shipping or offer shipping to USA you don t have business it s just stupid you have the product but no shipping what s the point
"Trade Assurance is just a marketing thing and has nothing to do with real customer protection. I ordered two smartphones and explained that I can get them before March 6, the UPS seized these phones and required me to provide an NBTC import license (hah just for two smartphones), the process of getting a license is impossibly hard, long, and complicated, I had no chance to get these phones before March 6. I explained it to the Alibaba dispute team, but they declined my request and did not return the money."
"Random crashes to home screen when browsing the sight and constant crashes when trying to delete messages within the app. 
Frustrating"
Excellent service. Affordable price.
I love Alibaba everything you need under one app and all the suppliers you can find to help you some excellent people and some not so helpful but that comes with the business I have found excellent suppliers and quality product I ve used DHgate not impressed never used aliexpress I m very happy with Alibaba and the phone interviews they do every once in awhile they care about me and I like that
"I have made many orders from Alibaba.com, everything arrived on time and the quantity was very good. Will be placing more orders this year again."
Was unable to put in my information
"Many times, the product descriptions are too vague. The more detail the better."
"I tried to connect with 3 companies and after starting to chat I didn t find any response from them.
It s seems this a fun website for someone."
I've ordered from many manufacturers here and almost all had great experiences. Over the years the site has improved quite a bit and the manufacturer offering has vastly improved.
"Great comunication from both sides.
Products are awesome."
The past couple months I have been looking up product but the photos won t load until you click on each product which is annoying.
The company especially Cathy worked with me very hard at getting it just right. Always there communicating with me. Made improvements and went over and above what I was asking for. They are #1 seller in my book.
Love it
"This app function is good.
But it is so strange that once I install this app, my document preview function on the other apps on iPhone just stops. 
I can not keep this app on my iPhone anymore. 
Could you guys check what s the problem and fix it soon?"
very easy to deal with. excellent communication
I highly recommend this app to buyers who are looking to save $$$ by ordering items from overseas at discounted prices.
A straight up got scammed out of $650 and when I reached out to Alibaba customer service it was everything but they sent me on a wild goose chase sending me links that I could not open and could not fill out and when I tried to tell them about it they just totally ignored me it's a crapshoot whether you get up honest deal on here or not I made a couple of deals before and had good service but when something goes wrong Alibaba is no help whatsoever they have the system set up to protect the criminal not the customer if you want to take a chance on sending your money over there be prepared to not get anything or your money back because Alibaba customer service is absolutely no customer service whatsoever it is a total run around and they will play games with you day in Day out for a month it's been going on with me they keep asking the same questions and they have all the proof that they need right there on their website to come to the conclusion that I got ripped off but they just completely ignored and do not care I would not recommend buying a box of Kleenex from Alibaba platform they do not police or screen the sellers on there whatsoever great place for scammers to make a killing
So far this app has been a useful and great way to find suppliers for my business I look forward to using Alibaba. For most of my business needs.
"Such a convoluted buying process. Have not found a single  Buy Now  button. You have to jump through all these hoops. Send snd inquiry. Ask specific questions, very specific. So you better know what it is exactly that you want or suffer the consequences. Then ask for a price. Just not a US buyer/seller type setup."
Ordering process has always been good through Alibaba. For the items I have purchased for my store and personal are freight is fair and never takes longer than about a week to arrive at my door.
Willing to do sample to let us see before we do the purchase.
The search feature on the app is ineffective.
You can find everything here
Its so cool
"The microphone is of high quality, has a pleasant balanced sound and does not have self noise. In my opinion, they are able to successfully compete with the best models of well-known brands. I'm a voiceover artist with over 20 years of experience and have worked with all types of microphones of great brands in my career and I know what I'm talking about. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.  ommunication and delivery were just as good."
"Prices are so low and payment methods are so easy to navigate, it helped me kickstart my online business!

Packaged arrived on time and it came in good condition. Thanks, Alibaba"
Every seller wants to do out of app transactions and shipping cost is the price of the product or double is cheaper and faster just to purchase in the states
"This sight would be great if there were actually ways to order things. It s a shame there are so many great direct from manufacture prices. But over the last 3 years, I ve tried to place several orders only to be denied, never answered, or have something shipped and have it never show up, or be a scam  this app and sight need to be regulated "
I can t even verify my email to get my account started so I don t see how this app is successful.
All but one company has done above board and very Good up front transparent business
"I have heard of this site,and am happy using it"
Just ordered products on Alibaba so we will see how the service and shipping is. I will write another review after I get my order to answer how everything goes!
Hard to search for product since it s not very specific.
Good and very responsive they have people atending at all times very good
I m 16 years old making 25k+/year. This app helps me tons!
The worst website I ve had theI ever had to use I would not recommend it to anyone half of the products can be shipped to the US and you won t know that till the seller really has your money and it s too late
Used the app one time and will not stop sending me emails. When you click unsubscribe it sends you to App Store. DO NOT USE. I will spread this throughout the business community until the emails stop. Emails are advertising emails.
"On the regular website it allows you to register an account via gmail quick access, which is what I did.  On the app, the only options for quick access are Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter.  So I cannot login using the app, only the desktop/mobile website."
Goo way to get details on products.
"I have used Alibaba for one order. As soon as I posted what I wanted, I got offers from several sellers and spent a few days combing through and asking questions. So long as you keep ALL communication on alibaba, I hope your experience will be as good as mine."
Luxe and easy..  
"If you ever copy paste anything, for the next 6 hours you will get a notification  ALIBABA COPY PASTED FROM GOOGLE  also the app itself is just clunky and slow and some images won t deliver."
"First time user with Alibaba and will certainly be using again. Did every thing they. said they would. Great supplier, great price & great service"
Haven't used it that much but I need to see feedback sections on each page so I could get outsiders description towards that product
Since I am new to this I make mistake have a difficult time understanding what I need to do and other stuff. I have accounts on other sites and they are just as hard for me
"LifePo4 Cells look like brand new. QR-Code Info about production-date was 9 Month old cells. Even the Aluminum-surface at the bottom of the screws was brand-new and never used before. All cells had the same voltage.
Great Service from Amy."
This Alibaba is the worst app you will buy one item for $10 and the shipping fee will be $200. Are you kidding me now?
The truth is very easy to navigate when it comes to contacting the provider very quickly and online gives more confidence
"Overall very happy with myexperience. Easy to communicate, supplier was very helpful and reliable.Product quality was in mint condition."
Great app by all standards
"On time, quality as expected and professional service"
My experience with this company has been awesome great customer service and feel you in every step of the way
I have found some companies that handle business very well. I am glad I joined.
All product you need is hear.
"I download wish to buy bulk item. In the end reply from seller side said only sell by container. This make me angry. Waste time to reply, and so rude reply."
This is a very good app
Alibaba is a great tool for buying at great price and reselling.
This app is so easy to reach world suppliers at anytime. I feel safe with this app and know that if there are issues they will be resolved.
The Alibaba App is amazing. It s makes researching for parts/suppliers so much easier. They really did an awesome job designing it. Very very easy to navigate around. Great Job on the design
"Good deals constantly..,!"
Awsome
yea thank you
Doesn't launch
Their customer service really set them apart for me. Winnie Zhang was exceptional in answering questions and providing guidance throughout the entire process.
"The ballerina shoes I ordered are very nice, the design as shown on the website, and great quality! Excellent customer service!
The only suggestion is to plan ahead; it took 7 weeks to get them with express delivery due to a delay in U.S. Customs. Other than that, I do not have any complaints."
I am very please with the products that I received even though I haven't gone through the whole box yet. It came quickly and customer service answered all my questions every time. Darlene was very friendly and knows the products and business very well which made buying very easy for e because I felt like I could trust her. I will definitely purchase from here again.
"Received in great condition, timing and quality as expected. Knew where my package was all the time (tracking). Excellent service!!!"
The response was great from the seller and received my order on time.
Good in everything
Because we are proud to have a website like this
BEST QUALITY
"I have the filling that you have good products and you are a good company. 
      
                           Keep up the good work

                                Yusef Amir"
The supplier had a kind and patient deal with me. In addition to sending the fast product.
Am new to this app or platform but I might say am amazed how you guys are running stuff here..keep it up
I really like the simplicity of the ordering process. Providing the total product & Shipping prices based volume pieces streamlined the preparation timeline .
I cant seem to login from my cellphone without a bunch of headache. Works fine from desktop some security they have makes it liters impossible for clients to access their accounts beyond frustrating ruins the quality of alibaba overall
"I'm very satisfied, and It worth waiting two weeks, because of it's high quality, and the design was exactly as the photos so neat and adorable, and as for the service I will describe it with three words "" understanding, friendly, and very professional"", and if I wanted more I won't give it a second thought to buy from them again."
"I love this app but just unhappy, online shopping is allowed in Egypt My county current location  "
Very poor customer service. Alibaba doesn t want to be held accountable for their Sellers neglect to be fair to paying customers. Would not recommend Ever in life.
"Excellent and well made bags with spout. Bags look and feel strong, with good welds and excellent manufacture."
Why did the developers of the app and website remove the filter tags? Now how am I supposed to narrow down my search options?
Order was exactly as described was sent in time. Parcel was very safe and profetional. I have confidence to by with Alibaba in future.
Wide range of items access and assistance to help buyers safely purchase. I really like the manufacturer reps. I have been impressed by the samples I have received and only paid for shipping.
It s best website to make save business
There is no protection for buyers they let scam artist run wild. Their on time guarentee and trade assurance means nothing. Warning do not use as alibaba will not protect the customer.
painful and both sides both seller and interlocutor do not respect the maximum times described in the contract goods not delivered bad impression with my customers and they don't even want to refund after 30 days of delay we don't even know where the package is
Has all the right items for women. Great prices!
Why after i log out then want to login My accout it bring me to taobou identify??.. i cant log on My alibaba accaount
I find everything I need in this app.
"I was scammed by a seller. Alibaba did not abide by their Trade Assurance Policy even with 50+ items of proof submitted they allowed it to happen.
Scam Company"
Quick and Prompt Shipment. Quality of Product is really good.
Sales staff was very helpful and guided the purchasing process really well. Product is good quality and easy to use.
Why can t a receive a certain product to my region?
Great app. Just need to add image search like aliexpress. Then it will be more convenient.
"After enter the amount of minimum order, I cannot close the keyboard. They is no way I can click the apply button if keyboard is still appear. Please fix"
"I can t get reliable info from vendors, often parts are sold separately and you are not sure if one component will fit another from a different vendor. Vendors don t reply to inquiries reliably and then send messages asking if you re ready to order. Many products are sold in bulk, minimum purchase of 1,000 or more totaling $950 or more without know what you are getting. Not recommended unless you are fluent in a Chinese/Mandarin. Impossible to delete app account and personal information they have already collected about you. This app is not recommended if you have security concerns. 0 out of 5 stars. Sorry Alibaba. Great idea but execution is a hard fail."
"You can t delete messages they just keep coming back , or any other thing it just keeps popping back up deleted many times"
Tons of suppliers and products to choose from. Welcome to the wonderful world of Ecommerce!
Very good customer service.
I spend a lot of time chatting with car dealers but they cannot prove their company has the car they are selling????? I send somebody in Poland to verify the company but they dont reply to call. Even the one in Germany and in UK my goodness Alibaba how could you keep scammer and if you want to call somebody in Alibaba to verify those company you cannot find Alibaba costumer care in here in Italy.....
I have no complaints about this app! All the suppliers will give you a MOQ for private labeling which is what I needed for my cosmetic and skincare line. This app is not for people wanting to buy 1 item this is a business app you buy in large quantities!!! So ignore reviews that are complaining about not being able to buy one item and have it shipped to your front porch. This is not Walmart. Anyway if you are familiar with dealing with customs and the way this business model works then definitely download this app!
"Experience was good as the Supplier remained clear, timely & precise. Dispatch was effected very fast via DHL and I even received the item one day earlier than indicated.

Excellent experience !"
Having trouble with loading my wishlist items . The screen goes completely blank ! Please fix .
"There should be a way buyers can leave reviews and comments on all of the suppliers. Some suppliers are scams, and some sell defective items. Us buyers need to know what we re gettin ourselves into."
good at talking and good at listening and everything I bought was good and that item I bought was super nice
"yes. this apps is good.
but most of the suppliers are"
"I love how the company is legit , so I don t worry about losing money and the products have quality"
Nice apps
Like your products
Lovely--------
"The item prices are very low, but shipping is usually outrageous, and buying more of something has equal proportional cost, it shouldn't cost proportionally equal."
"I don't know how anyone could give this app a positive review.  It is just a disorganized mess.  Of coursem the Alibaba webiste is a mess, and this app just makes it worse,  The messenger app is practically unusable and the app really doesn't support the order management process.  Just frustrating to use."
Easy order process. Item as described.
This app is so easy to use and helpful!
"I get fake people that don t want to sell. And spam information for trying to sell stuff that aren t real. Plus a rude seller that doesn t sell to retailers. He was also a spam person because when I asked him a certain question, he sent me the exact same answer again and again, like an automatic message from spam/scam calls! Don t buy and trust this app/website because you won t get nothing!"
I was stolen by some of Alibaba supplier and I tried to get help from Alibaba but they didn't reply at all so if you want your money don't deal with Alibaba
App is sooo goodddd
The price is right and time taken to delivery is fast
"I m super disappointed with Alibaba. I ve order a few times but recently had a situation where the e supplier sent the equipment without all the parts, changed the design and had bad welds. I reached out through the Trade Assurance program and Alibaba said there was very little they could do. They offered a very small compensation due to the manufacturer issue but the app does t have a UI button to accept the offer so I was unable to accept it. In addition to the guarantees of the Trade Assurance program being worthless the app was buggy leading to multiple attempts to try to resolve the situation. Really bummed with Alibaba."
This is great and I m looking forward to what this app will help with my business
"I had an excellent experience with the product I purchased, and it exceeded my expectations. The seller, ""Sam,"" was incredibly attentive to every detail and demonstrated a high level of professionalism in their work and the service they provided. I highly recommend their services."
the communication as the priority from alibaba.com really comfortable
I love this app been using it for four years
"professional, patience and customer service at its best!
highly recommended."
It is a horrible app
Poor performance and confusing interface.
"Very good app, easy to navigate and receive quick responses."
"I bought a mixer, and I paid $1200; he told me to make the payment through  Zelle  because Alibaba doesn't accept payments of less than $10,000, and I did. It's been five months I don't still get my item from the company called   Jp Global Trading LLC.  when I asked them about my thing, he told me to pay $2500 again to get my article. I tried many times to claim to Alibaba their website doesn't allow you to submit and no one wanted to help me. They don't pick up their phones and return their emails too; after that, I saw so many customers complaining they didn't get their item, so don't west your money and your time"
Great service & communication; very helpful with samples & logistics. First time using Alibaba and so far very pleased - final step is to receive shipment to the UK.
After a while the app stops allowing me to   things and I end up losing things I have interest in so hopefully that gets fixed soon
"The app is great and it has expanded my business but the one problem it has is it s messaging connection errors, crashing down all the time"
Very nice good applications
Best app
Just love it
This experience has been great and has made me feel very comfortable in making deals in the future.
"Great product nice design easy to setup, The AJCLOUD APP is very user friendly, very speedy service by vendor and fast in communicating, Alibaba and all including Factory and fedex excellent service looking forward to purchase other ones again soon. Thank you."
Their customer service is good
I been trying to reach no answer i think they want to rob us ?
Could not easily cancel services on alibaba cloud. Have tried on three occasions now and bills keep coming.
"Like the app very much, all the parts for my car is available but can t buy as single or a pair it s should buy as bulk qty, so I believe this app is good for bulk buyers"
"This is my second order of 5,000 pieces.
I recommend to all hoteliers.
Thank you Kathy"
App is mediocre. Sellers are shady. Shipping isn t included and vendors mark up shipping prices. I also had a bender send my expire product. I had proof and pictures and alibaba did nothing. Shame.
Absolutely awesome
Very easy to use   thanks
"smooth transaction! No problems, good communication, package arrived as described"
Alibaba is very great tool for us small business owners to explore opportunities available in eCommerce.
"From A to Z this company stands out for service and quality. From the people to the products, they are professional. After having some so,so experiences with other vendors, I can not say enough good things about this transaction."
There s to many scammers on here that are verified Nd they don t accept PayPal which is a safe way of paying and they don t wanna do business on alibaba but they re products are posted on alibaba
App is awesome and very useful!
Trust me just try it
"I m a SaudiArabia citizen, AliExpress is a great experience.. Future Marketing !"
"So far the vendors I ve communicated with have been very professional, helpful, diligent and good!!! I am happy with Essie & so many more who have had the patience to work with me.. 
  all day "
"I apparently brought Graphic cards from Alibaba in bulk quantity for upto $3,000. Their gold supplier recommended me to talk to them through whatsapp and send them money through western union which I did. He gave me fake shipping courier website, fake tracking number and now here I am, deprived of my hard-earned money. DONT EVER BUY FROM ALIBABA."
This app is a SCAM.  I ordered a tent and the supplier cam back with a totally different amount that I had to pay.  I had to apply for a defund.  Supplier would just refund my money.  I m now waiting for my money to be refunded.
Hank you for the quick response
All transactions have gone smooth so far except for one where supplier informed us they had no product so we are waiting and hoping for a full refund.
"Anytime I use this app I always find what I m looking for, the app is simple to navigate and checkout process is smooth ."
"I am needed you to explain the process  and what it is that I m suppose to accomplish. 
I want some quick training please . 
I can make this work a miracle. 
Send me some type of paperwork that I m hired and I m in school training."
Good  
Great experience. Im so satisfied with the price and the quality of the products.
"Still no support in the app for PayPal payments, which I m waiting for before I make any major purchases, since I don t trust a Chinese company with my credit card information."
"Overall pretty good app. Shipping from anywhere takes entirely too long though but that s a given. Unfortunately I had an EXTREMELY bad experience with this supplier 

<Shenzhen Pan-China Industry Co., Ltd.> 

because I left them a 1 star review. It was a very confusing transaction because I THOUGHT I was to be receiving 3 different products due to the order presenting 3 different pictures with 3 different descriptions (1 being a  gift ). I left a review THEN asked for a refund. They refused a refund, frustrated I was fine with the sample box & not receiving a refund, I agreed okay thru the Alibaba app; with that being said I stopped speaking to Amy Zhang because there was nothing else to discuss. However I am unsatisfied with the product (INSIDE DAMAGE AND LOOKED NOTHING LIKE EITHER 3 pictures) AND how Amy Zhang spoke to me. BECAUSE of MY REVIEW & MY EXPERIENCE with them/her, 2 weeks after the matter Amy Zhang felt the need to email my personal email accusing me of being a liar, of wanting free samples AND threatening to  shame my name  all over social medias if I did not change my review. Well, nothing has been resolved. I want Amy Zhang to stop harassing me about description boxes, I told her it was confusing and I already said okay!!!"
I love the way anyone can use the Alibaba system to order at wholesale which allows for great gift giving
"Time was one of the factor that make us work what this company and they understand and suggest us with new things, thanks."
Seems too good to be true I just downloaded the app I will order soon & we will find out !
I have great confidence with this supplier
"The app is enjoyable, but I am a new startup business, and many of the suppliers require that multiple units be purchased. I only need one unit of the items in which I am interested."
"Most boat manufacturers are showing low prices in the main ad. And some of them are putting prices telling that engines is included and even they name its HP, When you ask about offer they send you a separate price offer for engines. Please tell them to not do that. I mean Chinese companies."
The products I ve ordered in the pass has always  met my expectations.. totally!
"I haven t OFFICIALLY purchased anything, but I do have my eyes on a lot of products from this company. I see fair prices and that s okay with me! I think I may purchase most of my products from you guys!"
User friendly.
Was my first time using Alibaba.com site. Easy to order. Very fast shipping. The product is great quality and very useful for me. I am very impressed with Alibaba. Many thanks.
The app doesn t allow me to send messages to follow on order status or even submit a payment. I have to go to the actual website on computer and sign in. I have iPhone 12 plus. I should be able to do everything in the app as I do on the website.
Paid  2000 for car accessories. Products arrived completely different to those pictured and described. Terrible customer support. No refund and refused returns request
A very easy to use app. I have purchased woodworking items without any issues.
"You get lost within the app. Can t even find my favorites, can t create different favorite categories or lists!!"
Very nice
Completely Legit and excellent refund policy
The best place for going to shopping
Amazing
Very friendly apps and easy to use..
My Rep is responsive and always on target even with her load of clients. I ve had really great experiences and the items I m purchasing are top notch.
"The chat not working properly some times it stuck in connection 

And make it easy to navigate to the people in chat store it difficult to view their product from the chat"
Supportive to have such platform
Great place to find various products.
"fast shipping , client was very helpful and professional"
I would ve gave it five stars but I was unable to easily navigate what I was looking for. and compare products side-by-side.
"Love the website they have everything you could think of and great price, only negative is that shipping is too high for some vendors."
This is a great way to do business with the worldd
Very good response and support with very good materials quality
"Well I was gonna give a 5 star, but suddenly my review is unable to show any words as I am texting. I m not sure if it s because my English has to be translated, but I can t see anything that I just wrot right now. So I hope this get read. Anyhow, I was able to live chat with my supplier and I was very pleased with being able to see different options and negotiate prices. I am still waiting for my merchandise. I will write another review once I try it. And hopefully I will be able to see what I m writing so if there is a lot of mists, it s because I m writing without seeing and using just my thought as what next to say. Thank you"
Alibaba is a great company full of resources that are profitable to others.
I like to purchase from Alibaba for different and unique items that I can personalize for branding.
"Ashley was great, although a bit slow to respond compared to other suppliers."
"Hello , have good day 

Some supplier in Alibaba really no have original supplier , just open account in Alibaba 
So difficult to find supplier 
Thanks"
"the communication with the seller was very professional. The packaging is exactly what we expected, perfect. We will order again, that's fun. Faster than from Europe  "
Buying from Alibaba is a safe and secure way to get your goods.
"It maybe me, since I am new to site but it s a little awkward but I am sure I will get the hang of it. There maybe  something I don t understand that will make navigation easier with use."
great experience buying large excavator equipment directly from factory .
"This application is great application for B to B. However, this application has issues playing the videos. If we purchase samples or small quantity the shipping cost is so high, therefore we are unable to compete in the market. 
Hope Alibaba could provide us reasonable shipping options for the buyers."
"I will write a review just as soon as I have tested your generator. Thank you advance, Bill Gates"
Very interesting with fair prices
"The cellphone mode is si small in displaying data.
The laptop mode is not really fit the Tablet.

Thankyou"
The system is very good and guides a new customer well.
Good offers
App is efficient and fluid. Easy to use.
"So far companies on this app seem flaky.  I email and if I am lucky enough to get a response they stop responding after the first email and don t seem too pleased if your only interested in ordering the moq. Sorry I need all product and shipping details? My bad for inquiring about your other products? App could be better designed too, I feel it could flow a little better."
Great people to work with very friendly and nice!
Great costumer service
Great website. Some suppliers are horrible when it comes to replying to inquiries.
A platform with a good security service and communication with suppliers.
"The CSA, Sisi, is first class!"
"Completed  many purchases.  Excellent each time.  All deliveries were as advertised etc.  learn the metric system for all carpet, tile, and pricing.  Lol"
Exactly and wanting more of your service.
Good quality and trustworthy suppliers.
My account that I ve spend over $1000 is lost and now I can t even log into this new one I had to make. I want to speak to a person please.
I really appreciate your website. Very easy to look at and understand somewhat. I just need to speak to someone in regards to bulk buying
Going to to first Order in Alibaba
comenication with dealer is easy. World is small when im with alibaba.
I like Alibaba for their customer protection. Feel safe that they will protect your money on they gave good companies under them.
I personally find it quite hard to navigate the site
"I only buy on aliexpress, sellers are more friendly and transparent.  The purchase process is easier and shipping is cheaper.  Alibaba up front price is ridiculous and things are all expensive."
The best place to buy men sexy panties at a reasonable price so far I have not been disappointed
"Super professional and helpful, answered questions and provided product detailed information. Samples provided for approval in a timely manner. Provided photos for approval and final product exceeded our expectations. Very easy and smooth process."
"I want to give you all 5 stars. I never have an issue with my orders. But I have to give you 4 because, the app starts to move so slow. The scrolling gets stuck....to the point you have to foreclose the app and start back over. Please fix that issue."
Why can t users click on contents so the they select it to be able to copy and paste on this app? I have retype things when discussing with multiple vendors.
Sometimes I need to resort to Google.  If I am looking for a 12 watt small lamp I often get a bunch of many watt street lamps. There are some good ways to narrow a search but it isn t as intuitive as expected.
Really very good and helpful app
"I have purchased from numerous sellers and have never had an issue with pricing, purchasing or shipping and receiving. Alibaba continues to be my number one wholesale service to support my small business!"
Love the site to get custom made products for USA market to save money! Thanks
"Don't think that you get your refund once you paid the deposit for your order. It does not work like with Amazon, or other western based customer friendly systems. Alibaba favors the supplier at all times! No refund. Filing disputes is useless."
Dealing with Kelly has made every transaction super easy. Very reliable.
Do not trust there customer service will take your money and give no refund for accident or no good products
Hard to navigate
"Very friendly, helpful on the purchase of this bike."
here very awsome
"The service, the assistance, the product itself"
Everything is fine until you have a problem. Scamming seller that makes false claims is being protected by Alibaba. I have been buying on the platform for years but will not buy from there again.
good service knew I what I wanted found it fast gave quotation fast very professional
Best way to find products to maximize your profits!!
I was so impress how easy it was to make an inquiry with Ali Baba; my question now is shipping them to the islands from your end. How much will my cost be from China to Micronesia via USPS. Thank you
I afraid of the products not living up to potential and has to be returned. It would be a hassle to return overseas
Difficult to reach Customer Service in Alibaba.
It's as if you bought in a local market while the product comes from afar. I really like buying from alibaba because it is tracked and secure.
product quality and finishing are not good!
You give the app permission to track and allow to send notifications. No thanks uninstall
Very good aap Alibaba I like it
"DONT USE THIS APP. If you have any problems with the supplier they won t help you at all they will help the supplier only.
A company sold me fake apple products I reported them to Alibaba they didn t do anything 
I bought watches also and tge quality was horrible and alibaba didn t do anything literally anything."
The only complaint I have is the review section is too long and requires too much time.
Everything was made so easy and stress-free. Extremely happy  
Good apps.
Just starting today w/ Alibaba Hoping all goes well.
Very efficient process and good checks that everything went smoothly on an order.
Very easy to use and good products
98% of the vendors in here are not Manufacturing but just trading agents. NEVER believe the price that s listed I have never seen it correct. And usually the product is different than the photos. And this site is wrapped up with fake goods and copyright violations.
"Bought some products through Alibaba. $3400 !! 
5 months later the goods did not arrive. I asked for refund and seller denied. Then I escalated to Alibaba mediation. They do not want to refund and Alibaba does nothing about it. 
I will NEVER buy anything through them again. Be very careful. Most merchants are from China as is Alibaba. They will try to help each other at buyers loss."
Highly recomend. Proffesional supplyer. Buy whit no strees.
I cannot seem to move from the settings page.
"Hello guys greetings my name is Kley I am studying the possibility of being a future Alibaba customer, I am reading the comments towards the app and their expectations are based on half and miatd, is there any Alibaba customer that makes real recommendations for me? I would be very grateful for everything, I live in the North of the USA and I would like to know how reliable you are about delivery and prices on the page. Thank you!!! 
Kley Herdz"
"Company is great to work with kept me informed all the way through the order products are as described and I am very happy with them thus far. If you are in need of computers or any of their products I would highly recommend using them for your business
Thank you Maifan and keep up the great work"
"I am truly disappointed with Ali baba as we ordered some products from a supplier who have trade assurance and is a verified account, we were provided with a faulty product. We are just a small business starting up and When we filed for a dispute and submitted so much evidence showing the facts Ali baba still took the supplier side and left us with nothing. They are bias towards their suppliers and would not use this app again and would not recommend to anyone."
good app
Very professional service with my order and great care taken to make sure I received what I actually needed. Dora Huang is very nice to work with.
"Great product, great seller."
This app is so great i advise u try
Fast. Responsive. Reliable.
Cool app.
"The product is shipped well and works well when you first purchase it. However, I have had customers who purchased and a short time later the headphones stop working properly. They are only good for a short period. Therefore the quality is poor, and I will not repurchase."
Xiamen Beauty I would do business with this company in the future.
"Great, and everythings i am looking for is abailable here, and the feature is nice."
Its an amazing app
It has become worse! Cut and paste into the search many times does not work. The search in the past orders doesn't always find the order. The search for ingredients misses many suppliers. The rfp is terrible
This app is not good I was trying to by a food truck and they supplier never talked about fees shipping fees a cost more than the truck and he got upset when I asked my money back and tried to give me only 10% of the money that was paid and became very unprofessional because I would not settle for less and saying I can t get my money back now because of me putting the refund request 1/10 would not recommend if your looking for professional business and he told me about the fees after he got the full payment and then tried to disclose that I had to pay this
"Communication with company employees, their assistance at every stage."
"The seller was fantastic, the site has always been reliable and favorable to buyers. Would not hesitate to use again!"
Hi I am interested in testing the watch for free with out paying and review and keep it for free product testing and keep it for free
Good product on time delivery friendly supplier iam happy Thanks
This company shipped immediately and followed up with clear expectations. the device itself is in good working order and easy to use. this is a high quality company to deal with.
"Good to have a sample process, before ordering a big volume."
Good business to be with this app
I have a very rewarding experience with Alibaba and my supplier reacted well during the purchase process until delivery. I liked it
Good product
"I place order with trade assurance, forwarder failed to deliver goods. There was two main problem, one of them was one package received damaged, other is one package was missing. I communicated with forwarder about it and he told me to wait for the lost package. Due to his response I open first dispute for damaged goods and I received first refund. After he couldn't find lost package I open another dispute but unfortunately I lost, due to they see we made agreement on first dispute. They haven't asked forwarder to provide any documents about lost package."
"In the end it was great! This was my first time buying on Alibaba.com and I made my purchases right before the Lunar New Year. The transactions went through without a hitch, or so I thought until I looked my dashboard the following day. I was confused. Somehow I had to orders for the same item when I intended to only purchase one. I tried using the support function to get rid of one of them. It incorrectly told me to complete the purchase, however I pointed out that the charges had already been taken from my bank. I pressed farther and the system told me to make the purchase anyway and if it was duplicative it would refund automatically. This was all untrue. I followed the direction I was given and completed the second order. Which, I immediately knew was a mistake, so I cancelled the order and unfortunately was at the mercy of the seller to do me right and refund everything. It was a very uncomfortable experience and a couple hours of unnecessary time spent troubleshooting. I know how I'll handle those situations going forward, but using their chat function to try to resolve it was not a great use of my time to get my issue resolved. Lessons learned and I am moving on. Then because of the holiday season, nothing shipped. I wasn't too worried on one of my orders, but on the other the seller had already marked it as shipped and so the 'receive' countdown started while nothing was actually moving. So, I had to use my one receive time extension without knowing whether I would get my order in time or not. It would've been nice if I had the option to pause the receive countdown or one additional extension to account for the Lunar New Year period. It would've meant peace of mind for me. That said once my order started moving it was reassuring, and it did make it with a few days to spare. I was able to fully inspect my item and ensure everything was in order. I was very happy in the end, and my other order should be arriving soon. I am very much looking forward to using Alibaba for future purchases. Thank you so much for a very well thought through platform, and mostly functional customer support system."
I want to click on something and simply know what comes with it how much it costs and the minimum amount I can buy. Instead I have to click and scroll everywhere to piece together all the information.
"New here today, awsome verity& prices!! I will definitely spend more time at this site!!"
Very good
very good as usual. would recomend.
Easy and faster deal
"This app doesn't really explain how Alibaba works. I ordered an item and the price was clearly stated and the shipping fee. I placed the order and then the seller wanted double the price. When I canceled the order, Alibaba did not refund the sales tax they charged and deducted a transaction fee. I'm out $100 and have nothing. They say I have to apply for a tax refund but did not tell you how. This is illegal. Not sure if anything will ever happen since you can't sue a Chinese company. I would never recommend this app to anyone."
Amazing products at low prices. I love sheepskin and raw emeralds.
Once again everything is fine. No problem! Very good product and no complaints. Smooth processing as previously agreed and very good service. No long waiting times for clarification of questions about the article. Gladly again! Thank you Huang-san.
The customer service through this company is terrible some suppliers are legit some are straitUp thieves be careful who you deal with because if anything happens Alibaba will and cannot do anything about it and you will lose your money
"Zhang Haijun gibe me and excelent services , she is very resonsable and diligent with the order. I have the catalog of your ptoducts om time actualized . Thanks to Alibaba for have and extraordinary representive team"
"I recently purchased the Gamer Earphones Pink Cute Cat Ear Headphone from Shenzhen Weidu Times Technology Co., Ltd and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The earphones are not only stylish and cute with the pink cat ear design, but they are also incredibly functional as a wireless BT gaming headset. The sound quality is excellent, making it perfect for gaming or listening to music. I was also impressed with the customer service I received from the company. They were very helpful in answering all of my questions and the delivery was incredibly fast. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a great pair of wireless gaming earphones that are both functional and stylish. I give it 5 stars for its overall value, quality, and customer service."
"Excellent quality of cloth labels, very good service & communication,"
It is the first time that I buy something through Alibaba.com and I really recommend it.
"I m happy with the supplier and product offered to me, Item receive in perfect conditions and the correct quantity."
"Hello, Mohindra Dukhu here. I'm having trouble accessing all my favorites to decide on which one to purchase that I liked, on my alibaba app. Please help me access my full catalog I have in my favorites, so that I can take my time to decide what I want to purchase, when I choose to purchase an item."
"Ordered from a vendor, it wasn t what I wanted so I tried to send the items back and get a refund. So obviously you CANT get a refund unless the SELLER agrees which would be a 1-10 because nobody wants to give people money back ! So now I m out of $300 dollars and have product I can t sell.!!! Whatever you order make sure you get pictures and videos !!!!"
Do not order from this app there s nothing but false advertisement on it  if I can give it zero stars I would
Its amazing app 100% satisfied
"Im in another country and I received in a few days , Wow !!! Thank you to everyone involved."
Not understanding why the state/place of most business doesn t have klarna as an option.... please add the U.S an option.
m This App Is Great. Recommend For Small Businesses For Sure!
This app can make trading very helpful!!
Alibaba has been a reliable source for parts and machinery to use in our business products and manufacturing.
"The shipment and receipt of the package was a success. The attention was fast, cordial and very professional, especially from Kelly Ma, who was very cordial, attentive and willing to help me in the purchase and shipment of the equipment."
Quick to respond to messages and very professional and helpful.
"I tried to buy something and they asked for my WhatsApp so i could get more videos and pictures of the  tem and on the app it said 5,200 for the  tem and when we talked on WhatsApp it was 9,500+ and they said the low price was for promotion."
Fast and secure
"It s so nice app I trust 
I invited my friend here and every one ask me"
Terrible customer service and they block you from paying with any credit cards or safety net payment for yourself! They only accept western union and wire transfer. They don t care about the customers  safety
I ve never order anything from this app and i want to know if it would be worth it... ? Who are the best vendors to shop with? And can you just order straight from the app instead of dealing with a vendor?
yes good
"Unable to get payment link from suppliers as my account hasn't been verified. when I loggin to submit KYC, it says its already submitted. Unable to move further with the orders"
Descriptions of items aren t correct and seems as if no one can ship to United States
"Hello, for me in lobparticular this application is not very good, they do not comply with what is established, for example I have made 2 requests, 1 of which was lost along the way and no one knew how to give me an answer about what happened and 2 at this time I preside over another request 1 month ago and it's still in China   and I write every day and the only thing they say is not to despair in conclusion the app does not respond to the guarantee"
"I am a new customer for Alibaba, I would like to know if I can 3 dozens of your products instead of your minimum required"
"Great move of confidence when dealing with Ali no need for paypal, greay reporting to client."
I got to know three companies.  but above they are not doing as contract  and don't pay me back ... I have lost $ 3000 on these apps
I was pushed by eBay to this app only because I was looking for a single item and it is here in America for about $80-$120bucks brand new or $16-$40 bucks plus $539 dollars for freight from China! The people were all helpful and the sets means time the app was a learning experience for me so not a waste of time. I want to delete my information on the app but it seems like it is not accessible to doing so. That s the part I don t like and how lots of people are asking me but when I tried to close the question I pose the automated artificial intelligence chat told me repeatedly that it wasn t updated so I m digging trying to find out how to get to an updated version within the app it s telling. Don t like that.
"Was really excited when I learned about the request for a quote since I thought it would be easier to find a supplier, but each time I tried it, it just goes to a white screen and never loads. Kinda disappointing"
"When purchasing a timepiece, albeit watch, ring or chain, it is extremely important in doing your research and due diligence to protect yourself from people who are trying to scam. Having a good forwarder or even a reseller who real time experience with the supplier.

Making a purchase makes most sense to pay a bit more but have the confidence with the supplier of that product. Full Access Klass of Kings, is the go to resource online where you can rest assured that what you pay for, you get.

Customer Satisfaction is the pinnacle of their business model. Look them up, you wont be disappointed

"Everything ran OK !
Product received in time (just 3 weeks) !
Product as expected !
Very goood experience"
"I placed an order of alcohol pads right when the pandemic started due to the lack of protective materials there were in the USA. The seller send me a package with the wrong FDA approval information ( False) and therefore the goods couldn t get released. I made a request to the seller to do DDP and they refused as they knew they wouldn t be able to clear to what they sent it DAP which means I had to do clearance in Aduana. They never provided me with the correct info in order for me to be able to clear my order. The order was sent back to them and they received it. Although refused to give me a refund. I lost $3500 and Alibaba s Trade Assurance didn t help me to get my money. I provided all the proofs to show my innocence into this case and as I didn t know what DAP meant, and the Seller took advantage of it, I showed all emails trends from DHL, messages to seller requesting for the goods to arrive to my door which it never happened and they promised it would be like that. I showed the false information they provided me with in regards with FDA. Although, the seller only provided a small PDF with no legal validation or no contact information from any legal source. They denied my refund and failed in favor of the Seller who stole my money. Not mentioning they would maintain the case open for more than 6 months. 
Be careful don t believe trade assurance will protect, the truth is that they wont. And it s extremely sad they just took ur money in the middle of the pandemic tragedy knowing I wasn t counting with any extra income and I used savings to huy alcohol pads for my family. Disgusting, they all just thieves."
Love to buy products here
Very simple process. I would highly recommend.
Very good service. Quick reply. Quick delivery. Firm packing!
Amazing work as always by the crew Lisa and Angelina
I am completely satisfied!!!
I am trying to understand how to talk with a supplier. I want to start a boutique but I need items on a regular bases but it is hard to get in touch with a supplier.
"I'm not completely sure of the purpose for this app, but I think it's for business use and not personal use because a lot
Of items require you to purchase 100 pieces. I would never need this many.
I found some that said 1 piece minimum that had a good price range like $1-50 which is cheap for gymnastics equipment which I was trying to buy. So I messaged the buyer, she was friendly but gave me a price way over the price range. Was disappointed. I'm guessing the price range is before shipping cost because it sounds like shipping is what added the couple hundred of dollars to the price. Shipping needs to be Included in the price range."
Bergek's CNC and plate quality is very high quality. Both manufacture and delivery schedule is on time without delay.
"Good service, product quality, communications and delivery"
The supplier chatted with me until I was absolutely satisfied with the colour I needed. The order was shipped quickly and corresponded exactly to what I expected.
I like it
"Very good , responsible powerful site."
Able to make a living off of this site.
I m so very interested in your market
"I have been a long time purchaser of alibaba and aliexpress. I make custom products I design myself. One day I checked the market on alibaba and seen my designs were stolen. 

I reached out to the company selling it and let them know. They immediately told them I must cooperate with them or they will steal all my designs and message all of my followers and give them free samples of my design. They then sent me a screen shot of my Instagram account.

Then I go on my Instagram account and they start harassing me and my customers. So BEWARE buying from Alibaba or aliexpress. I never will ever again because it was kind of scary and because of them stealing my designs I can no longer compete with prices and had to shut down my once very thriving business."
If I would ve known about Ali Baba a few years ago I would be a millionaire already but I m well on my way now thanks Ali Baba
"1) very very bad experience on Alibaba.com took trade assurance 100% unsafe at all plenty of time contact him higher team reply 2-3 day again and again till full month passed after protection finished but i am open matter more than a month how much cheap and cheat peoples online. 2) Late Dispatch according Alibaba.com rules could not follow his own rules. Really rubbish, bad supplier and himself cheat peoples."
Quality and design are like I need and seem very good. Probably I will repeat
Been missing out on opportunities when I could have just got this app and got to work
This app take you information and then you can t delete the account it s sofa king ridiculous!
"This app is just sad. Responses do not come. Also, there s no way to delete your information once you create an account, and no way to delete your account."
my supplier made this experience great for me
How do I know what my shipping costs will n.   B.
It seems you must sign every time you want to see a different tab under myalibaba. It is an amazing waste of time.
I m having a hard time understanding half of the things they are talking about. It seems like they have good prices but the shipping & handling fee is kind of ridiculous. Please help me out with this matter. I m jus trying to learn how to buy from them & have a reasonable price. Especially with the shipping & handling fee & the item/items getting sent to the USA
"Has som great products as best as I can tell in photos. I d like see more info/discription
On products. I m really interested in mini metal lathes/ milling

Thank you"
Every thing you dream of Iin one place and the prices are unmatched by anyone. I have spen hrs looking at how many deferent items are in one place
"Product was well constructed, looked great and priced right. George was professional and accommodating. He kept me informed as to status. I am very happy. Will work with him again."
App shuts down upon opening the application
"What an awful app, keep crashing and takes long time to respond in my iphoneX, i already deleted it several times with the same result.
Keep it up, better for me."
A well rounded reliable site for ALL of your wholesale needs!
"Easy to use, fast and all the information I need. Very pleased!"
"I will never ever use this site again
I bought a product for over 250 Dollars. The item came broken, never ever turned on! Seller told me he doesn't accept return then alibaba gave me a day to decide whether I would have the item inspected by a third party company but I would have to pay from 600 dollars!!! What one earth is this and how is this even legal? The seller basically called me a liar despite me taking photos /videos of the product clearly not turning on!! Stay away from this app/website! If something goes wrong you will never get your money back! I really needed this product as I am terminally Ill and now I am out of pocket! I have been scammed and now I can't even buy a replacement as I've lost my money :("
"Alibaba app is good. Only issues I have is when I pay a supplier , my app gets stuck afterwards on that page. I can t get off the page and I have to delete and reinstall the app every time. The second issue is that they only give you a certain window to write a review. For me, I dropship so it takes a while for the product to reach the warehouse and for me to get feedback from customers. When I went to give a review it was too late."
Everything was great until my chat stopped working. I ve tried uninstalling then reinstalling. But I can t get it to work. When I try to use the chat on the mobile site it takes me to the app. The chat on the desktop site is incredibly slow.
Contact some suppliers in China.
"Shanghai Yizhuo Industrial Co., Ltd."
"The reason why I gave this 1 star it s simple when I first downloaded this app, I didn t have any problems with it but today I can t even open or read my messages it s always closing it don t even give me time to search ,I hope this issue gets fixed soon please, thank you.."
Need to make more options for delivery by all routes.
Pretty fun!
Love the number of choices. Easy communication and quick ship.
The Deals look great. Closing the deal is where they overcharge in some companies. Some are quick and sending demo . And the other 50 % ignore you unless you have a what s up app .
Successfully used to obtain difficult to source components.
"I hope to hear from factories that makes NFL and MLB and NBA jerseys.
Respectfully,
Sonny Fonseca"
Thanks for your great Web Site
Please add LinkedIn option so people can use their linkedin profile to login.
Never had any issues dealing with Verified suppliers.
I have total faith in Alibaba for my purchases. As long as you use their in house payments. do not pay a vendor outside of the platform and you can be assured that all will go well
Very happy with the quality and design of this paddle. It is much more compact than my other Greenland paddle and can be easily packed in my case when traveling.
A good app
"Sellers have good prices but they will rip you off with high shipping costs, which it will cost more and it won t be worth to re-sell. Also, sellers should work a little bit more on comparing prices with other vendors."
"Very professional and positive experience working with this supplier. Nice quality product, fast communications and replies to our questions. Would definately recommend to others."
"The fact that the app does not rotate to landscape mode, renders my iPad keyboard useless. How hard is this?"
"excellent, thanks"
Outstanding baby!  
Seem to be good place to find a provider. Hope all going well
"Love the great communication, also the custumer service.
My sample was on Time without any Fedex issues.
Great gloves with good quality..."
not bad
Best for starting business!
"Trade assurance is a joke. 

I placed a handful of orders with no issues. Now suddenly I ve run into two suppliers who are both giving me issues. Both have been active on  Alibaba for awhile with some reviews that weren t bad. so I figured they were safe. Wrong.

One sent me products that look nothing like what they advertised and they even said they were made terribly when I requested a refund. I refused to accept a partial refund for a $400+ order so I opened a case against them. Alibaba felt their $75 refund was generous and I should accept since they d let me keep the items. These items were literal garbage, why would I want them? Ended up filing a claim with my bank since alibaba was zero help.

Other supplier marked my order as shipped weeks ago and the tracking looks like it wasn t even sent to FedEx yet. Now the supplier is ignoring my messages. Awesome. Do not shop alibaba unless you feel like throwing your cash away"
"Great product, great service . Most likely to continue work with same manufacture. Best regards, lali K."
iPad version on both Alibaba andnexpres are awful slow luggish even on prommodel
I feel very happy with this app is complete
Need to add a feature where you can see actually what shipping will cost to USA. To vague and expensive in many cases
"Communication were perfect, reactive and helpful. Products are compliant as requested. Packing were ok, only few pieces were broken."
I m so happy and excited to buy this dress for my daughter.
"I like Alibaba and I ve been using it for my business for a year. Recently, I haven t been able to see reviews on products. I don t know if it s because of the recent app update, but please fix it. I can t purchase products if I can t see reviews. Even on my computer, it won t let me click to see them."
It is very difficult to understand your site. I don t understand why you don t have more single use minimum order of one.
"Some postings show a certain minimum but when you contact the manufacturer, they change to a much higher quantity."
"I ve been scammed on here and reported it but they favored the other side. I never received anything and I even have the order saying never been delivered yet. Another problem from a different transaction was they had on there a guaranteed delivery date but the order came in over a month after. I even took a screenshot of the guaranteed date and it shows the actual date I received it. This was for a customer which needed the items by a certain date for a bridal shower. I lost that business now for good and they will definitely not recommend any new customers to me. If anything they will most likely hurt my business if anyone tried going to me they probably will tell them what happened and I will lose a potential customer. This is very unprofessional. I m asking for my refund for the items which I believe is fair. They denied my claim. Alibaba is not a good reliable reasonable business. I hope someone actually starts getting on this before this happens to other people. Good Luck, To future Alibaba customers"
Separate pages for overview and details is troublesome
I hope if there is better way to order direct and I can see all the prices in a good way
"We need any contact number for more clarifications 

Thank you"
Ordered a few hundred pieces from here and received mostly broken or damaged. None of which could ve been done through shipping. Wouldn t recommend Alibaba to anyone who wants good quality items. Stick to American company s if you can.
Need to be able to zoom into small text on cell phone.  Can do on website on phone but not in the appp
"Hard to send emails and multitask simultaneously. If you leave the email screen before sending you will lose everything (i.e, if you are confirming details from a previous email).
You can't delete all the useless quotes you receive (at least I haven't figured out how).
You also can't clean up all the email responses."
First time checking this site out and I could not believe how easy you could find what your looking for. I would recommend this site for people who want an easy way to order an item or just to compare pricing.
"I can t use my app at all. I can t search or check my messages. Can I get a fix, I love the app"
Loving this app. I feel like I should have known about it sooner! Easy contact with manufacturers and transactions have been super smooth.
This app is use full
"There are no published costs. You must write to each company.  Pretty useless.
Difficult to find things.  They seem to do some weird grouping. For example, they show a $3,000,000 nitric acid plant for sale next to medical supplies."
Products don t load on app. And only if you tap each item you see what it is. Please fix this issue
"Alibaba doesn't care of buyer but they only care of seller. This is my recent experience. In case dispute happen with your order, this process will run continue till your life, they will not doing anything except asking evidence to upload every 24 hours, can you imagine, I have been uploading more than 12 times still asking to upload. Such a Mad architecture of Alibaba & owner who accepted this process, why? only refund not inisitaed.

Seller : Yiwu Zheweijin E-Commerce Co., Ltd

Please never buy from this seller, he is very close of Alibaba hence if you have any issue then Alibaba will not support you!

Want to buy from above seller - do your own risk."
Alibaba works much better on Microsoft than iPad. AliExpress works better on iPad then alibaba.  No reason it cannot be better.
"Alibaba offers a direct line to the people making my products. This means there is greater transparency, enabling retailers to sell products with confidence knowing the companies they buy from are following strict codes of ethics. Buying directly from manufacturers via alibaba also means we are able to sell to our customers at a lower rate due to cutting out many of the middle men traditionally importing and exporting and taking a huge cut. Alibaba is safe and accountable and I am very happy using the service they provide. Thank you!!"
I doing online business and i find alibaba supply me the way out to design what product that i need. And could find the best price...
very reliable with the world to offer at super good pricing! keep it up!
It's okay
The company is very responsive and very professional. Willing to help and resolve if there are existing problems.
Not bad
"Really Nice Company.
Its cozy when ordering.They are friendly and professional. I got all answers from my questions which called professional. No doubt I will keep my business with them."
"Very good
Thank you
Amazing quality"
"Shipping was fast, product is what I expected, manager was great"
"The whole experience is a bit overwhelming. The product search is a bit tedious and there is no spell checking on products and many are not spelled correctly, making it difficult to search for the items you want. I haven't used the site many times and maybe it would be easier to use with more experience but it is not a very user friendly site overall for first time users. I did manage to get my order in and received goods. Mostly I think the overall layout of the site could be a little less confusing."
The picture quality is wonderful and content very good. Sometimes when I try downloading it freezes up and leaves me with a blank page.
"It very important to be able to track your item, it does not provide any sources of trace, tracking in the app or website"
I was able to get my order it was nicely packed the garments were in execellent condition and my customers love them.
Fast delivery and very accommodating seller
"I am US based but I am thinking of doing online selling in the Philippines.  What is the logistics of goods shipped to the Victorias, Negros Occidental in the Philippines."
This is the worst experience we have ever had. To pay so much for 2 wrong products sent out by this supplier and we can not get this sorted. There is no point having trade assurance when they can t even understand we have been sold and sent wrong items. This has put us off using this platform again. We were very excited to keep looking for new products for our business. Now we know we get sent wrong products and can t do anything about it won t be using again. Will not recommend either. Very disappointed. The products are wrong
"Product arrived on time, undamaged, exactly as detailed in the order. Not every seller is top-notch, make sure you read reviews and make sure you clarify what you need when placing an order. Alibaba is great."
Need more development but fine
"Can only use the app on an iPad if you turn your iPad sideways.  Very inconvenient.  

A company the size of Alibaba should be able to produce an app that supports iPads."
Great

"New user to alibaba, but no stranger to using sourcing apps for our business.  Hands down one of the best designed and smoothest apps I have used.  Able to access and enjoy everything I need through its intuitive and friendly arrangement. 

My review is based on the applications user experience and not based on what some other reviews seem to harp over."
Not able to access webpage to order and I m a legitimate company
The supplier is easy to communicate. the products i ordered are of good quality and price.
I hate this! Why can t just settle everything using the app???!!!
I have been getting unwanted calls from all over the world after making purchase and provided my phone number to seller. Very unhappy with this.
It's good
"This company is versatile, technologically advanced, very complete and always offers the best affordable prices on a multitude of global products. Clays Schwab himselfWould be impressed. I would vote that if one day there ever was an export import trade monopoly owned by a single oligarch,My vote would be Ollie Bobba takes the global supply chain to another stock market options level. Jeff Bozos should be on alert  China might be Starting a market protection proprietary war between these great suppliers."
dog loved it for the short period of time- better for non aggressive dog.. but the dog definitely loved this thing.. i just wish more durable for more a aggressive dog...no issues with the product...but once our dog honed in on the squeaky.. it was over for the furritos...
Easily browse 1000's of items
Love Love and Love my mens joggers and cant wait to add them to my scrub and leisure wear line
"I am very happy with the attention of Xena Wang, her speed in finding good prices and good products. I recommend Xena and the application, everything came to me very well"
It s been almost 3 months since I placed an order for express delivery. I still haven t received my order or gotten a refund. Unprofessional.
"I wanted to buy an expensive electronic item. 2 sellers responded back to my request using WhatsApp. None of them were verified by Alibaba. 

One seller used one name in his original response through Alibaba. Then he had a picture of a young white male, named Brian, from United Kingdom in his WhatsApp message. 

I asked if I can use PayPal, he said no. I asked him if we can process payment through Alibaba, he said Alibaba is for advertisement only. The payment has to be made through Cashapp or be deposited to his bank account.  He gave me an account number in UK with a Nigerian name to send the payment to.

Alibaba is providing a sales platform, not an advertising platform. So they still bear responsibility, legally as well as morally, not to contribute to a scam process that clearly involves them. It is like I let people to use my vehicle to rub other people."
A very transparent and honest supplier. Communication and readiness to help was beyond expectation.
"Overall I like alibaba for the b2b, this company need to focus on Ipad version also, i am using a iPad Pro 10.5 and the iPad version on the messages i cant ready my messages fully. Hopefully they can fix the messeges setting."
"Ali baba is an amazing app that you could find everything you want to buy, personal or business. Thank you for this amazing app."
"Tracy's excellent service, fast question answer, better fallow up and supporting with any detail we needed. providing safety and reliability with them since the very beginning ."
Newbie to the site but it's been real easy to navigate.
"Notifications show even after reading all messages. Fix this. EDIT: Yes, This is under messenger."
Seems easy to work on.
I really love the convenience of the application on my phone is very courteous and professional I m excited
Never seen anything of its Quality
"I bought an amount of powder for medicinal use, and when I received the substance it was fake and it caused harm to me, and when I asked the seller to return the substance, he did not accept and the customer service center intervened and asked me to analyze the material, but the analysis costs more than the price of the substance five times, in the end the seller threatened me that he owns  My address and name will be published on the Internet and cause trouble for me and threaten me, and when I showed these documents to the site in the report !!  
They didn't pay any attention and nothing happened !!!  On this site, if you are not Chinese, they will never listen to you. 
This is what the seller said insulted me and told me: So that you know who China is !!!  The seller threatened me that he would send me his men to my home address registered in the shipment.  
For your family safety I advise you not to put your real address on this website that protects these gangs."
"Hangs up in use, very difficult to back out of a problem"
"There are areas where you'll get chinese font which i dont understand. Make full english/chinese/russian ty

& please add more currency

Eg : MYR"
"Great experience working with this company for developing a customized exclusive product.
Professional job."
"The search engine is not always user friendly, when selecting a particular item the screen display something else, also when looking for an item there is more items displayed that is not what I am searching for and sometimes my search is not displayed at all"
"A company that is very easy to work with, polite, professional, and helpful every step of the process."
"I m not seeing all the messages here, sometimes if it s wholesale or express or on a desktop site or b2b it s just different or the same, but only depending on what you re doing. 

I want to be a seller, but where do I find that? I don t know at all."
The best site with the lowest prices in the offer !!!
"Good product.
Good package"
"We bought a zero turn mover and for wheeler and ATV and paid $5,000 and turned out we got scamed check every company that sells threw them and Alibaba did not pay us back or even close them down, they are still scamming people!"
"I loose almos 1,000 buying hair from 2 differents manufacturers ans both was the same. They said they offer a best top quality hair and it s not true ! The hair seems fine ans smell good when you received but as soon as you try on actually a head get bad not even a couple months I m talking about less than a week! I think the customer service get preference for the supplies! I send evidence for the bad quality hair and they just ignora that boths time ! The supplies have a very bad idea of if you try the hair you cannot return it ! But I believe when you try the hair is when you know for sure the quality of the hair in a package everything seems fine and great quality ! I don t recommend this! Is a waits of energy, money and it s very stressful!"
Good selection great prices
Highly Recommended for business owners and anyone that wants the best bang for their buck!!
There is no one on one ability to talk to customer service. I have an issue and I felt like it was urgent. I wanted to know did ALIBABA accept payment through PayPal for merchants in India. Is this a good idea or not?
alibaba give me confidence that I can trust the merchant.
This app is great but for some reason when I follow a manufacturer it will not keep following them I have to keep doing it hoping it will stay in my favorites and it does not show pictures on product pages of manufacturers please just fix the bugs it s dumb .
"Reliable, fast and prompt"
Any wait to start buying my new equipment
The selection and prices are great I enjoy searching this site for my company it s all in one shopping
They say you have purchase protection. But you don t. I received an order that was not described as sold. Alibaba refused to return my money. They sided with the Chinese seller. I submitted evidence to prove it and that still wasn t enough. I cannot use or sell what I was sold. Don t use this service.
"most of the businesses does not know hot to respond timely, i inquired about ads of gem stones and jewelries and no anwer"
I am trying to purchase items but not sure if pieces refer to package or individual pieces in any package.  That needs to be made clear.
"All the items are of good quality. Best service from Alan, always keeping me updated. I will purchase again in the near future. Thanks"
Messages won t download. I only get notifications and that s sometimes.
"I purchased fabric from a vendor by the name of Tina G,  and she was great she was very friendly and knowledgeable and she shipped the fabric out less than seven days and I received it in about four days. And once I receive my fabric I Loved it .... I can t wait to purchase from her again Thanks..
    
Tina G."
"Alibaba connects me with suppliers that are thoroughly professional. Thanks to the site I now work with a great printer, and I can recommend quality tools to my industry colleagues. Messaging with companies is easy and paying for orders couldn t be easier. I ve tried numerous times to work with companies on my side of the world but they expect me to compromise on what I need for my business. I don t have that experience with companies on Alibaba."
"Though the packaging is a bit of problem, The supplier are willing to solve the issue and will follow up with it."
If it s custom order it a year out. I ve never been jerked around so much in my entire life. It s worth the extra money to just do your business in the United States
"Easy to navigate, communicate & manage."
I have not yet used this service to truly give rating. But will update after I have received packages and services.
The new update makes it impossible to look for anything without coming up with blank pages.
"An excellent job, very good result and great communication throughout the design process by Angela Kuo. Fast shipping. Highly recommended company."
I ve ordered several items and all are exactly as shown. The variety is outstanding. The quality on all items is fantastic. Do not hesitate to order from Alibaba. I m over the moon with this web site.
Piper has been nothing but helpful and professional. She always replies quickly and has helped us with everything we have requested. We could not be happier with her. Products arrived in a timely manner.
timely delivery of the product. quality as promised
Whatever they did messages don t work anymore
The supplier I bought from was excellent. The product was superb and of really good quality. Shipping was done in about 3 weeks from China to South Africa. Very good. Will definitely buy from Alibaba again
Excellent service and i would reorder soon
"When clicking on a link in my email from Alibaba, or when viewing a supplier s mini-site on Alibaba in a browser, the link does not open the Alibaba app and take me directly to the page for the link that I clicked on. Clicking on the link takes me to the App Store, where I can only click  open  to open the Alibaba app, which is already on my phone; and when I click  open , I m still only taken to the app s default start  page ."
There are alot of options on Alibaba.com that will guarantee you get your products and that your orders are insured!
Keep up the good work haha
"They good support, fast responding and product quality meed as we required."
"Nice and intuitive app, very easy to use"
very good delivery The product is not damaged and is fast.and the product works very well
The service was okay. The product was not what I was expecting but it will serve the purpose. I will definitely buy from the supplier again.
Great but it's not functioning properly when I want to order
"Be careful ordering product through them, I ordered large orders / Pallets worth of products from China the company sent me tons of broken case's. Customer service did not help me and was difficult. You can't leave reviews after 30 days and shipments take months to come in. I felt completely taken advantage of and will never order from here again. Order at your own risk! I lost thousands of dollars."
Great experience. Thank you
"They never care about costumer, more than 10 times I sent them massage about my items, but they never ever respond me, not recommended to buy from alibaba, don t waist your time and money"
"Very easy to work with, I will order again."
"First time using and it was easy to order
the watch,
Thank you.
Awaiting to purchase masks"
"Good result with a purchase by DPD in Basen, the most important thing is that the seller has a reputation and you have references."
Best
Have not purchased a product yet but am interested in many items.
really gooooooooood
"I received the item, and everything is fine."
We are not a huge buyer but have been using Alibaba several times a year. Very happy with the service the downside our bank HSBC will not link this forces us to use an expensive card.
"People, this app is for importers.  Some items can be bought by individuals but you have to be familiar with importing and using escrow accounts."
"Fantastic service, order delivered in a very short time.
Contact person was so efficient, I will recommand this service."
Great agent. We have been working with him for half a year now. Everything is always clear and fast. I recommend.
How many people use WhatsApp for the business they do on this app I m new and I ve been flipped once unable to get my money back.  I just wanted to know if that s how they communicate with you from this app.
Nice marketplace
Still learning but wow great app guys!

"I first I was a bit confused on how it worked
You you need to ask lots of questions. For the must they have a wonderful work skill and they are very helpful."
App keep disconnecting multiple times. Extremely inconvenient
"He did his job meticulously and neatly.
Trouble-free shopping was realized by giving clear answers to every question."
Overall the experience is good but I think the shipping side should be better explained. For beginners the incoterms specification is a bit complicated and many suppliers put DAP service in ready to ship orders. So I believe you should simplify and inform buyers about this kind of service. There is the translation which is correct but sometimes of poor quality. But overall the service and the elements in place are very good.
I search for a hard to find product en Alibaba does make it apear to be abble to supply me. After installing there app. To place de order the product can t be found
Very quick response! friendly and warm atmosphere!
"I am not for sale just only buy for use personal, is it can ?"
All vendors that I ve been in contact with has exceeded my idea of excellence and provided a great buying experience
Start shopping in America and give local American businesses your money. China does. Not care about us they just want our money. I will not buy from them.
I was buy riser from one of seller on this website but the item i received was not same on the item of pictures on seller listed i tried to getting a free refund tried to open a case but the result is alibaba said there its not effects the product but i think this result its not fair because was received the thing its not same on item list.
"Always happy with my purchases and prompt responses to inquiries. Makes my life easier trusting in them. 
Thank you much

These web site is full of scammers. Today I lose 500 dollars buying in these shop and the costumers suport don t help me solved the issue couse they are in conspirancy with the scammers letting thems do these on these page and making so dificult create a cleim
Whole selling power tools to get ppl to go to work
When trying to delete your card information it doesn t give you an option and I ve been trying all resources they give
I use Alibaba to source a wide variety of products for my business and personal use. It can be tricky to figure out which suppliers are better than others. Some have really great pricing and are willing to make you happy while others can have attitude and be kind of rude. Usually there are no problems and I get my orders within the estimated time frame if not sooner. Don't be afraid to message several suppliers asking their pricing and turnaround time to compare.
I have received 4 quote on batteries from 4 different companies all quotes where a lot higher than the price in my cart and one company that I was going to buy from when I got to the point to pay the price went up by 50% a lot of false advertising
"I ordered 10 tables on a trade assured order that had guaranteed delivery time and price. The supplier messages after and says the information is wrong and to apply for a refund. Then they refused to accept the refund when I put incorrect shipping information as they claimed they would be fined. They only accepted when I changed the reason. They then approve the full refund but I don't get back the $70 USD alibaba trading fee that I paid. Was in contact several times with customer service and they said I would get it back, never did. Everytime I contact now, they say they will escalate to a senior team for review and then nothing ever happens. Avoid this scam app/site."
"This was my first Alibaba.com purchase so had reservations. It went very smoothly and as expected. We received the order within the expected time frame, it was packaged well. The Trade Assurance made me more comfortable with the whole transaction, as this was a large purchase."
"Speak directly with manufacturers to find exactly what you need, for the best price."
No way of creating favorites list or important contact list.
"I use this app to contact my suppliers , but image transfer is so slow , some times I have to try more than 20 time"
I love this App. I am very satisfied with the service as well.
Very good service.. Would recommend using them for your business needs.
There is reassurance that you will receive the product you order because of the Alibaba Trade Assurance. The seller was also great to deal with and will certainly be purchasing from them again
Very convenient in locating products for wholesale
"It was legit, contrary to my original expectations, very helpful and fast."
I need to see more information about the iTranslate more and also the clear prices for the items and how do the saller saleing it meaning if the saleing with bulk or wholesalers or by patter the the prices
This is really useful....
"The deal with the seller was very professional, agile and helped me choose the right products for my needs. The goods was sent on time without delay, and I received it in very good condition."
"Excellent transaction every time. We've never had one issue with service, quality, understanding or anything else. Our emails & questions are answered promptly."
I have been dealing with Zoe and she answers all my question very quickly. Everything she promise she has delivered!
Every time I order from Alibaba I know that I have the convenience of choosing from many suppliers in one unique location. It also helps having the confidence of Alibaba backing the transactions between the merchants and myself. Don t forget to check the shipping details as well!
"When they change their customer support I will change my review. So hard getting ahold of them. They do not have a dedicated line and their dispute is basically a dead end.

Sorry but this is unacceptable"
"I really enjoy using Alibaba to do ordering it's that feeling that someone has your back. With all the info at your finger tips, you can feel good about your order."
"Tried shopping 100 4 gigabytes thumb drive, it s harder like shopping for a car"
"Alibaba as always been the best online store, the most reliable."
Great app can improve tracking service but other then that it was a pleasure making thousands a year from retail
B2B buy direct from Chinese suppliers for a fraction of the cost to buy elsewhere.
I love it app Alibaba is great app
"I found a bit complicated, too many steps to find out prices and contacting suppliers.
Please need to be more straightforward 
Thank you
Sergio"
"Hello , I love using alibaba but for some reason it takes my messages hours to send sometimes and I have no idea why."
nice apps
nice
We want to buy single products from here sometimes
Shipping takes months even if you pay for DHL and some items are fake and do not even work.
We have used Alibaba to help source jewelry packaging from several suppliers over the past year. We have always had a trusted process and excellent service.
Nepal Delivery Problem I'm not happy
"I ve been burned two out of two times that I actually ordered anything via Alibaba.  Never received material.  Victim of fraud, apparent phishing.  They are extremely good at deceiving.  I even used the trade assurance part of the app and took a picture of it with my iPhone.  It later disappeared.  Sent the photo to alibaba showing the photo of trade assurance receipt saying I had paid for product.  They never replied and there is no record other than my photo.  It all disappeared.  No record of messages with the vendor on Alibaba."
Love this app and the majority of the sellers are also awesome! When you find your favorite keep it   .... shipping can sometimes take up to 4 months is the only down fall but others arrive in a month or two
"Our company (located in the USA) has been using the services provided by alibaba.com for several years. We love the web site (very east to navigate) and the vendors in China that we have connected with have been super friendly, cooperative, flexible and have delivered products we ordered in a timely manner with terrific quality. We highly recommend Alibaba.com for your product sourcing needs!"
Great communication. Knowledgeable. Prompt quote and delivery.
Great service ! willing to work with me to insure satisfaction.
"from the quality, the design, the service i was impressed"
"Corrupt website always siding on a dispute with their Chinese suppliers. Once you open a dispute and they close it, you can t reopen another one. Even if your goods never arrived. They just tell you to wait longer!? Then if they never arrive you can t get your money back."
"They are pretty and solid! After hurricane Michael I lost my two bedroom houses and it would be awesome if I could replace them with these pretty and save containers homes, You should have and affiliate partner in the United States! It would be awesome I would love to represent you here I live Florida in the northwest I will represent you here but any ways a lot of people looking for rent because more than half of the lost their house! Thank you Alibaba! At your prices you be good to all those people that me need a home! Thank you  Superboricua"
"Too hard to use, can t change email, you have to contact everyone. Can t delete account without calling. Wish it was like a regular app. It s weird."
Great site
"Barely able to spend 10min on the app before it stops working. Get a new programmer or something, new updates haven't stop the glitches"
I love shopping this app. You can Google the pictures and find exactly what you want
price of shipment is high. overall satisfied
"I have browsed the app for a long time,  uneasy about doing business in China i have looked closely at the sellers.  Lots of shiny BS plaque images and certifications that seem blustery.  I decided to try it and I finally placed an order for items that are a part of my manufactured product.  I was sent the wrong parts (clearly NOT WHAT WAS ORDERED) and the seller offer a 5$ refund  .  I opened a dispute in Alibaba and so far nothing has been done other than suggesting a 5$ refund was reasonable.  This might be a cultural difference I m not aware of BUT in the US if i send someone something other than what they ordered,  I pay to get it back and I refund the money.  In my mind this is as it should be.  In Alibaba s mind 5$ back and I keep the useless items makes more sense.  So my review is this,  its a gamblers app.  Maybe you ll get the product you want, maybe you wont.  Either way if theres a problem, your money is gone and odds of getting it back are as close to zero as they ll get."
"EXCELENTE, GRACIAS POR TODO"
Maggie Yau needs to lift her professionalism.
Ike was and is a great help so far to us. Very understanding and patient! And made a great effort to our wishes.
Im excited! I hope this goes well!
"I keep getting this your account is abnormal message ,i went through the unlocking process bc it said my environment was risky??? And still cant log in i even tried making another accouns and nothing , cant even get to the customer service bc i need to log in"
I m excited and always waiting to find more and more great finds.
the order it coming like i order
Lies all lies. They support criminals imagine buying something with your hard earned money and some one send you a picture instead of the product.
"App is ok but there needs to be some sort of monitoring for scams. I sell online and was very excited about this app. I contacted 10 sellers 8 never got back to me or would only say  how many you want  and not answer any of my questions about the product, 1 wanted to know every little bit of person information including my address, telephone number and social security number and 1 seller quoted me a price of triple what the item is listed for. Waste of my time."
"I want to buy one, own one and proudly drive one!"
I m really enjoying the level of quality and hope to keep people informed about their options-options equals opportunity!
"Alibaba makes it very easy to do business.
The search engine for matching products can be improved."
"As far as connecting with suppliers, communicating and ordering, Alibaba is user friendly. The problem is, as a US buyer, you have little to no protection against dishonest suppliers. You are really at the mercy of the suppliers to be honest and provide a good product. Alibaba's ""Trade Assurance"" program only applies to approved Chinese sellers, not other countries. And Trade Assurance is designed to favor the suppliers and in many cases, block complaints from buyers. We have lost several thousand dollars due to unscrupulous suppliers on Alibaba; as a small business foreign buyer, I recommend avoiding Alibaba."
You Surprise me all the time. Something  New  every time I LOOK!
Not bad  
"We would certainly order with this company again! Production/shipping took less than 3 weeks, the quality and printing were great and the prices were super reasonable! Very easy to work with. Will be ordering more from them soon."
"This has been a very good experience for me. This was my first time, and I have share my experience already with more than forty people. I have talk about with my entire family and many others. I am impressed with the treatment that I received from Mrs Nancy, who was the seller, but also She represented me in China. She expended a lot of time with me looking to satisfy my needs and She did it. I am very thankful with Her work and kindness, gentleness and professional actitud. Now, I am trying to buy another equipment because I am pretty sure that is the best thing that I can do. Thank you Mrs Nancy and all people that took part in this business. God Bless You All. Thank you."
It s so much better when using the computer. I hate that on the app it doesn t show store reviews
Although I have yet to place my order. I love the products they have to offer!  Hopefully they will fulfill all my needs. I look forward to doing business here!
Great experience! Thank you!
"Professional, courteous, responds to every request immediately,
Her service is excellent
Pushed me to concentrate every purchase I need with her
Well done to her"
Amazing service and accessibility.
"All Good Perfect delivery.
Great Experience with Supplier."
"The seller was easy to work with, shipped on the and all the items were exactly as described, matched the pictures perfectly."
Very safe and good place for both customers and suppliers. Thank you Alibaba team.
Way to go Alibaba you are doing a great job  
"This site allows companies to sell products made with stolen intellectual property. Powertools such as Stihl, Makita, Dewalt, Milwaukee are all stolen brands. Each of these companies have very tight supply chains and would not allow their high standards of quality products to be sold for 70% to 80% less than they sell in retail stores."
"Cannot seem to login now. When I enter try to sign in, it goes the the Verification code page and just hangs there."
"Why is this app tracking me across the web as well as my location, contacts and financial information?  I use alibaba frequently but I have to uninstall this and will use it less because of their anti-privacy practices."
"The customer service is non-helpful and by the time you ll try to get the issue through their heads, you ll waste days. So you re better off just going to the bank and disputing it.
Contacted the customer service, and after staying with them in a chat for 2 hours, they just brushed it off; and i mean they because i spoke to a bunch of different people, who either didn t know what to do or simply wouldn t reply. So the worst service so far."
Great resource for small business!
A few hiccups along the way regarding communication but in the end I received the light and am happy with the transaction. Make sure you discuss a time table on custom jobs. I will purchase from again.
Any product I looked into for shipping to states was outrageous . No longer buying or using products from alibabi or China !
"The order was sent on time and in full, the packaging is good, the product is intact, there are spare parts and equipment."
"Easy, no hassle and quick. Great communication and the product looks beautiful. Thank you!"
"Very good communication, fast shipping, took 14 days to arrive. The device was plugged in immediately after delivery, everything works the first time. I would welcome a manual in English and a link to the software download. Otherwise Great satisfaction! I believe that it will keep working for a long time. I recommend seller."
It my first time using the app and it good !!!
"WARN WARN WARN
i bought products 14000$,i didnt receive any thing of the goods,i opened dispute and alibaba ask for proofs and evidence,i put all proofs and evidence,nothing happened,ALIBABA platform protect the seller scammers and not the buyers,i made order on NOV 2020 and till now i didnt get my money back.
DO NOT order with alibaba Platform!"
Just be sure to view  details  of any product you buy from any shipper on this app. Asian sizes and US sizes are not the same. Other than that VERY GREAT APP
This app keeps getting better in every way. From search index to Supplier information. I find it more useful to connect with overseas suppliers and keeping in touch with them. Great description on prices and lead time. Good job! Keep it up.
I am very sad because 2 despite buying with 2 verified sellers and it's been more than 30 days and I don't have my products and I can't find a place to report them since I don't have my money to buy with another seller and I don't have my money either
I can't see the products information
Fast shipping. Thanks.
Absolutely love this app and the vendors!! Quick service prompt and professional
"Great quality of item, and recieved it even earlier than the expected date."
This app is good
Proffessional Service
"We are extremely satisfied with the supplier's products, communication and support."
Good job alibaba's team
Great Start in using site!!
This has been a very useful app to use when I'm on the go and need to contact my supplier. Very user friendly.
"The seller raise the shipping cost after you already bought and they take too much time to do a refund, very longggggg"
They keep blocking my account without a reason i made 2 purchase on alibaba and they blocked me without even giving me a explanation of what was going to happen with my purchase I contacted there support service and they haven t replied not buying over alibaba ever again
Simplicity at its best. Shopping for the company from United States of America & finding great deals and negotiating. Great way to do international business.
Very good experience this alibaba
"Very helpful sales consultant. Always friendly, prompt, knowledgeable about product, extremely efficient and a good representative of her company"
Fast and reliable delivery and quality o products.
Very good trustful and honest with there service
I love ordering here
If this works out it is Awesome!!!! I hope I get the part I need for my Grandsons Quad!
"Good communication, professional and fast delivery!"
I prefer shops that already allow purchase without inquiries. This is cumbersome.
Great site and app! Find some hidden gems and great prices!!
Comminucations is OK sadly the manuals are partly there.
I am impressed with the degree of immediate response I get.  Much faster than manual search!
AWSOME!!! Haru Chen is THE BEST!!!
Even through they sell great stuff some of the suppliers are thieves and take  your money without send the product or provide a refund this app is not supervised like dhgate will not order from this site again.
"My very first time buying things in China, alibaba.com had something that no other resources had. Registration is easy, purchases are easy and secure after you read info about how to purchase from Alibaba securely. I managed using Alibaba's prompts and my own research to find a safe shop with a good history of sells. Everything went smoothly. Since Alibaba is just a platform, it cannot guarantee 100% that all suppliers and sellers are secure there, but it made sure to mark those who are. But of course, the responsibility is only yours to research, make sure you use these prompts from Alibaba and choose a good supplier."
I have always had very good results
Click on one item out of curiosity and all of the sudden that product floods my feed. Overwhelming saturation of the same product after ONE click. Terrible and frustrating. I can t engage with new suppliers because I can t get real recommendations or relevant products 
Good affordable price
Useful
"The shipping cost is high, and the application has a few errors when searching, which does not give accurate results, and it is difficult to add a product to purchase."
"Language is not as much of a problem as I had expected, and just requires some patience and basic understanding. The vast number of suppliers accessible through the platform truly make it my one stop shop for product sourcing."
"I as well as a couple of my friends have  been trying to place an order through this website to. I avail. When we try to confirm the order we are sent back to the order page. 
Please make your web page user friendly"
"I m trying to stay in touch with my Sellers, and the app won t let me sign in. It authenticates, and then immediately logs me out. I m stuck with just using the regular site on mobile."
"If you re a business person in the retailer industry and you don t have this app you need to get it now . Prices are great plus you speak directly to the manufacturer, no middle man ."
"It s just amazing to trade on this site from speedy delivery to product quality everything is superbly well organized.
I really love this site."
"I agree with the writer who mentioned language and custom/shipping barriers. 
Maybe Alibaba could provide this service for its clients both manufacturing and purchasing.  It would be a game changer.  
Language problems are persistent.  Often some nice young person SEEMS to understand but subsequent conversations make it clear they didn t even read my questions.  
David O.  NM USA.u"
Perfect quality and services. Nice to do bussiness.
"communicate well , reactive and ddp ok"
For me the app is amazing a lot of things to see and buy but I wish they had more options for following the buyers you like and options to change ur name and information on your business
"The review platform has been upgraded and while I think there is just too much going on on the home page,
its okay"
"Friendly service and a willingness to help and be of great assistance.
Was a very smooth transaction, and Elsa Lee was very polite and a pleasure to do business with.
Thank you."
Great service and attention; a friendly experience
App works well on I pad
"Very professional through the years
Keep going !"
very good.  
Best shopping site ever
Iv tried to use 4 different credit cards 2 bank cards paypall all failed. The customer support is absolutely terrible. Know one can seem to help me or understand what my problem is.
"Alibaba is simply the best b2b site 
Real business happens right here"
"All goods arrived. the quality is norm. will be working with Alibaba in the future.
Thanks Ma :)"
"I had a terrible experience since the supplier who has gold rating, has been on Alibaba for three years decided to raise the price of the product after I paid. I requested a refund a have to wait 3 weeks for the money to be refunded. The banking fee of 46$ will not be refunded. I will not use this website anymore and would suggest that no one from the US goes through what I went through."
I was pressed for time and I find a vendor that was able to provide exactly what I needed. The shipping was fast and made it to me a week prior to when I needed them. The lady I worked with for my order was a pleasure to work with.
Great platform to find good suppliers and products. I have been buying for or over 2 years and never had an issue.
So easy to start
"Our experience purchasing from suppliers out of country was make simple and easy. I felt we had the protection and processes to be confident in our purchase. We will be continuing to make more orders though more suppliers for our small business in the future, and Alibaba makes it easy and safe!"
"Hey Kerry, This is Top-Notch-Repair just checking in to make sure that you got a response back yet?"
"it was a pleasure !
thank u for the service
i will buy again soon :)"
Heard about this seller and thought I would try it. Entered my product description and got all sorts of unrelated merchandise. Wasn t worth my time to sort through it. Too bad.
Its a perfect tool and a channel to China manufactures and suppliers. The expirience is perfect and we use it one year and every month we make many many purchases for our shipyard needs. We also buy from alibaba and sell to our local clients in Greece. We prefer verifited supplier.
anyone thinking of buying through alibaba will not be disappointed with their easy to use website and very reassuring buyer protection
It s very difficult to do business here. It would be great to be able to just buy something or bid for it instead of having to go back and forth for days. It s very inefficient.
Great customer service all the time. Fast shipping and well package. Good quality products. I will continue to do business with them.
"good product, excellent shipping time and packing."
I love it its very good website easy to use and I feel is nothing missing here its perfect market place the world is lucky for having alibaba its wide big gate for the world .
"When I search I often want to search again with a small change to the search term, but I have to retype everything each time, rather than refining my search. 

I d rather you keep my search term and provide me with an x to clear those search."
Very pleased with the whole buying process with this company. Great quality product.
"Alibaba are not a reliable , they only support chinese business companies, Alibaba give me US$ 5800 loss, i have never got my money back, Please do not trust Alibaba, most of chinese company are cheating .

Alibaba is just a lie nothing else"
Think this is a good business app i would love to buy goods here
Easy to use even for newbies
"During the whole process the support received was first class.

Everything quoted and stated was met without fault.

The product itself is also wonderful and overall a very satisfying purchase and experience."
the payment method quite difficult as need to keep logging in. and some error keep on happening during payment
"fast shipping, easy comunication, great products"
"After browsing and adding an item to my favorites, the app asks me to verify. I follow the instructions and very with sms but then I m taken to a white screen that doesn t load. Very annoying. No issue using the website."
Nice product
Good services
"Very annoying when you search something no matter what all this people harass you like Dogs. I cant stop them, I asked to only allow people I contact and still nothing has been done. I might stop using Alibaba soon because of that. 
I dont want nobody contacting me if I dont initiate the call or message."
"Good quality products, professional services, friendly & efficient communication, on time delivery."
I have tried ordering. I ve furnished all the info for my id and they keep saying I haven t proven my acct isn t fraudulent. I never have a problem with my other acct. I m very unhappy
I actually find using the app easier than the website sometimes.
I was a railway track engr. I have already been retired from service on 31/12/2014.
I love this app but don't disappoint me please
"We ordered furniture for a new hair saloon and the lady who helped us was so professional, kind and helpful that I would recommend everyone to use this supplier. The shipment was on time and now waiting for the goods to arrive in Belgium"
Yes it is the apps fault want to know why because they keep shipping cost information out of sight. If your truly an honest company then exactly why wouldn't you allow the buyers to see there options for shipping costs its not always available. Ill purchase something handling the shipping costs then have the supplier hitting me up for over $120 for shipping . The product was $70 i paid about $60 for shipping and now your telling me i have to pay an additional $120. I refuse then they give the option well you can have it shipped by sea i say sea it is. Then they say ok we will refund you $30 for the shipping by sea still waiting on that refund. But my whole thing is the shipping costs were already taken care of why is it that every supplier hits me up after . Requesting ridiculous shipping fees.
"Very difficult to buy anything so disappointed of this web site,it s have been a week I m trying to make a business and nobody even take the time to answer,not recommended at all"
Hello dear I know this not a place to write a message but I need to contact you directly through an email or a phone number as I wanna know information about your products because I need huge quantities of some products.. thanks!
Amazing!
Send me more fabulous latest at an affordable price cheaper than quoted. Love these a lot. Would like more of it. The shipping cost will also be appreciated. Thanks
"Thank you so much for these shirts! I LOVE them, the quality is perfect and the branding is just what I requested! Highly recommend Yunnan Xulaixi Trading Co!!! I am hooked! I will definitely order from this company from now on! Customer service is awesome also!"
"Horrible , I give it a one out. Of ten they act like  we can t get on the. Phone , they done took my. Acccount and keep saying go to customer service , it ain t no help they won t let me use my phone number or nothing it s horrible ."
Do you need to bring back landscape mode in the app?
"I am extremely happy with the performance of this supplier. My sales person Karin with the company is absolutely amazing because she is quick to stay on top of all of my needs and makes sure everything is 100% satisfactory with what I ask and she is very quick to do so. She is helpful in every single way and I think the company is very luck to have her as an employee. I couldn't be more happy working her and the company to grow my business. HIGHLY recommend Guangzhou Wenchang Car Appliances Co., Ltd!"
"As of right now, I purchased one excavator in alibaba, and I'm very pleased with the professionalism and feedback from the manufacture. Alicia was very very efficient and I'm very happy and will recommend to anyone."
Thing look great but I need to know about shipping cost before I can order
"Most of the supplier i deal with were honest and i have appreciated their services.
The only thing not good i did not receive my refund requested for a mobile phone purchased which didn't work with my country network.

Thanks Alibaba for your platform."
"IF ANYONE DECIDE TO DO ANY BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY, DON T BECAUSE THEY ARE A RIPOFF AND WILL NOT MAIL YIU YIUR DOCUMENTS. I placed an order back in August and paid for the order in September and they are not sending my items and is saying they have delivered all products when in fact that s a lie. They advised me that tariff fees were due but ups said it wasn t! They took my money and I have lost all the way around paying them 1611 total and not receiving not one product from this company.! They are horrible bad business and they are not trying to assist me with me getting my items."
Good.
"Easy, faster and uncomplicated. Definitely recommend"
I like this place many hours on here
I ordered jute placemats and was nervous about the delivery time and what the quality would be. The mats arrived earlier than expected and the placemats exceeded my expectations. I bought the placemats directly from the manufacturer for less than half the local rental rate.
"I like Alibaba a lot, however it needs to be brought up how the app malfunctions in chat and after-order services. There is no legitimate reason for it to crash or a seller claims not being able to do something simple like reporting a tracking number. With a large order showing  successfully delivered  in a different US state- I d never know if I was getting scammed by the supplier. The dismissiveness about resolving was riding the clock. Like most carriers, UPS has its quirks but is great with reporting a shipment s location. The screenshot I was sent did not match with UPS global nor domestic and I am a customer. It had not made it to the carrier at all while the seller listed a USPS Express shipment (5-7 days) to Alibaba. It s been 60+ days, still waiting for a complete shipment but if I respond in mobile it resets. I should not have to pay full price and was probably overcharged for shipping. 

I was glad to get Alibaba to step in with their Trade assurance policy. If there is a post-order concern, I ve noticed the app freezes & crashes a lot. It also resets requests. Alibaba runs paying Buyers away with this App. I trust the service but I d expect functions to be way better than eBay s App to disappointment. I really hope there s improvements to come, but desktop mode is better."
"So incredibly frustrating, I have lost money and opportunities due to constantly being locked out of my account and having to contact customer service that gets no where."
Don t care for this app or businesses sellers try to get you to pay with western union and money gram. PayPal is good but no one wants this. There are a lot of non trustworthy people on his site that wanted me to chat with them and pay them money off this website
"I ordered a dress year 2020 in November for Christmas (More then enough time to get it for Christmas). Said it was delivered I never got the product, tried getting ahold of the seller over 10 times through out the past 3 years still no reply or contact back. I spent $20 on that dress, not that I m worried about the money but it was a waste of time, when I had planned for pictures that Christmas. 3 years later still no product, contact, or even a refund."
They did a nice job building this website
I m very happy with my order and my E bike and very happy with all the help I received from Fred Chen he was very knowledgeable about my order and took care of helping me with all the information I needed thanks again Fred
I tried getting my refund for 2 orders it said it would take up to 30 days I waited now it just says it s closed and that I was refunded I never got my money back and there is nothing I can do about it
"Great quality product, fast service easy to communicate."
"They understand what I need
All the items give me what I was looking for"
"I am very happy and satisfied. The delivery was in time, the items were packed very safe. The quantity was correct and the quality seems to be pretty good. All in all a good cooperation! Thank you!"
"On the site you can create an account with google, and sign in with google.

Not so on the app, which makes no sense."
"I tried buying several items. As an example, I d see an item marked $1-$2. I d start the order and offer the high end $2. Every single time, the seller came back and changed the price to like $4.50. Every time they over doubled their advertised priced. I usually get screwed when I buy stuff from China on eBay. This is just a website full of those scammers."
Gloria was perfect and very helpful. She works hard and understand fast! The quality of the product is amazing. Thanks
"This is the worst website navigation ever. Will not apply discounts, wants you to order 60 dresses which is insane."
"good service, professional"
It can be important for me
"very good sales rep
professional and reliable service"
I have been a customer with Alibaba for a very long time. And the products and services that I have received have been excellent.
I wanted to buy something from the website and when they sent an email back I had to reply but i didn t Have the app so I had to download the app but when I open the app or try use it all I see is a white screen and I can t reply
The text is very hard to read. You need to have a darker color perhaps black instead of gray?
"Alibaba lets people all over the world interact in business. Alibaba facilitates very much companies who want promotional articles in big sizes. The only thing with Alibaba is the thing with the chats its kind of oncomfortable they should automatically update, and we shouldn t have 2 different chats with the same information m."
Best site to source
I just started but love the very responsiveness that I see and hope I can work some great deals and start B2B on there platform.
Easy to a search
Five stars all around.  I m still testing a few suppliers and companies but so far I m blown away and in love with this app. Great job guys and gals
I haven't use it yet but I believe it's OK! 
The supplier remembered exactly my previous purchase though it was few years ago. The exact model and documentation were ready in a very short time. Delivery was unexpected - really very fast!
"I love this app and am so going to start buying products once I get everything order, but it needs some updates. Like I can t favorite things anymore, it just keeps saying error and to try later. So please fix that. I really depend on that to know what suppliers I ll want to buy from and what products I m mostly interested in. Thank you."
"Great variety of suppliers and products. 
The distinction between inquiries and messaging is very confusing and the user interface with messaging and speed is like a 3rd grader made the app. Needs to be quicker and smoother and very clear."
"My husband spent hours trying to find a  supplier  and finally found a company that had  good  reviews on the site (which must be lies and planted there by the company!) He placed an order for an item that cost $1,185usd and the listing offered shipping for $380usd. He paid in full and the next day, received a message from the  supplier  stating that the shipping was incorrect and he needed to send $3,000usd more for shipping or apply for a refund! The item he ordered was only $2,500usd locally! He then applied for a refund from alibaba only to find out that they wouldn t refund the processing fees or taxes! He was going to have to accept a $200usd loss!!! The only thing that saved him was the fact that he used PayPal to pay initially and he sent screenshots of what was going on to PayPal and they ruled in his favor and gave him a full refund  just want to let everyone know of the risk you take when messing with an app that literally allows anyone in China to offer anything they want to get your money and then keep money when you ask for a refund so they re making money on the people getting scammed as well!!!"
"In my first time using this website, I made 2 purchases from different providers, both of which resulted in fraud. and the app says that it is not responsible for anything. giving up all my money I made a complaint to logistics, pointing out who cheated me but what a change of profile, trying not to rip anyone else off. the system does nothing! They don't care that they keep scamming people.

There is a type of secure purchase in the app. but they are only like 5 articles. it should be everyone. my advice: don't waste your time or money using this app."
"I liked that these adapters purchased were exactly as described. They work good with the device I plugged into them. They company is going to make a lot of sales because the price is low, quality is good, and they can be relied upon for delivery from halfway across the world. All in all it was a great experience!"
We are new to Alibaba. We are an American based holistic health care company that combines the ancient wisdom of eastern medicine ancient knowledge of the human-bio-computer. We are just learning how to share on this trading platform. We welcome your assistant.
Great selection and communications!
"I ordered Hydraulic hydraulic valves, never received.
 Then I also ordered two lap top computers, received late damaged and only a keyboard without monitor arrived to my neighbors unit. 
Last time I order from China I said,to my self, but I needed help with test diagnostic equipment, the price was overwhelming so I ordered, to find out, a floppy computer disc arrived that was not compatible to my computer drives and not in English. More loss money. 
But recently I had a requirement for a hydraulic seal kit for a pump I am rebuilding, I was quoted long lead times and no availability s.
So I found Allibaba Express paid and received on time the correct item in excellent condition and the vendor kept me updated on the progress of my order. The best service I received anywhere. Next I need a Tandem aluminum hydraulic pump crossing my fingers."
Tried to use website and place an order . Not like using eBay . I can t understand why sellers don t make it easier and include shipping cost .
Received my package (50pcs clear pvc bags) with scratches all over it! They re VISIBLE scratches and bags were badly deformed! I applied for a refund under Alibaba s Trade Assurance and submitted all evidences such as video and photos but their response is for me to pay for an inspection that costs at least $600!!!!! SCAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Wanting to start a business

"After upgrading to the last Alibaba App version 6.8.0  it crashes everytime at startup. Was not before. Please fix this.

Developers solution worked! Upgrade to new 6.8.2 did the trick! Thank you."
Best way to make bulk purchase on the planet!
"DO NOT BUY FROM HERE . THEY HAVE AN F FOR THE BBB I SHOULDVE BEEN PAID ATTENTION TO THAT ! 
NEVER EVER SHOPPING WITH THEM AGAIN . FOR 1 THEIR SUPPLIERS IS UNPROFESSIONAL & ALIBABA ALLOWS THAT ! I CANT EVEN FILE A COMPLAINT CAUSE THEY SAID SHE SHIPPED IT IN TIME BUT NEVER DID I SAY I WAS FILING A COMPLAINT CAUSE OF THAT IM FILING A COMPLAINT FOR THE UNPROFESSIONALISM BOTH THE SUPPLIER AND THE AGENT GAVE ME . FOR THE THE AGENT LIED SAYIN ALIBABA DONT HAVE A NUMBER & REFUSED TO GIVE ME THE COMPLAINT LINK OR FILE A COMPLAINT I HAD TO CONTACT ANOTHER AGENT WHICH SHE WAS HELPFUL . WHEN I FILE A COMPLAINT ALIBABA EMAILED ME SAYIN THEY COULD NOT PROCESS COMPLAINT BECAUSE SIMPLY SHE SHIPPED IT IN TIME AND COMPLETELY JUST DOGED WHEN I SAID ITS FOR THE UNPROFESSIONAL NOT FOR HER SHIPPING TIME NO MATTER WHAT YOU CANNOT WIN . EVEN WITH PROOF I COULD NOT WIN WHAT THE SUPPLIER SAYS GO AND ALIBABA IS BACKIN THEM UP ."
"publish all search made by all users then let suppliers find and contact them.

In other words publish all search queries, and let the suppliers find & contact those, who did the queries.

Also please include shipping marketplace (RFQ & directory for shipping Alibaba products)"
It's an easy way to order my wholesale merchandise straight from the manufacturer.
"very professional and easy communication, goods deliver on time with good quality."
Been selling and buying here for years let s go Brklyn nets
Your paying retail price for cheap Chinese products. Price gouging and pocket watching businesses . After trying for years on this app the results are the same you cant get anything from a real manufacturer here.
I suggested to change the name to : Rubbishbaba

Thank you for being an amazing vendor and a wonderful person to work with, and thank you for all that you do."
Alibaba is a scam. They take your money and then you will end up with very low quality product that is completely different than what you promised then you go back to them for their quality assurance program or the quick refund program and they do nothing for you then you end up with garbage product that you paid for and your Chinese supplier doesn't want to see back. They only protect the seller and will screw the buyer every time over and over so I never do business with him if you want to not be screwed.
Quick delivery and good help during the order procedure
This site uses a bunch of adds. However when you contact the supplier. The adds are 100% false. I have yet to contact 2 suppliers that the price is listed correctly. You can check my profile for everyone I reached out too.
Please advise how to delete my account.  Thank you.
"I purchased three items from Quanzhou Yunuo Kitchen & Bath Co., Ltd, Fujian, China on 12/29/2022, but got wrong items on 03/20/2023. Customer services and buyer refused refund. This is first time that I use Alibaba to purchase items. Don't recommend anyone to use this website to purchase. Alibaba customer service is unfair to buyers."
The whole process from beginning to end was great. 11 days to make the product and 32 days to receive it in the states. A win-win as far as I am concerned!
"Very fine and usefull
Tq alibaba"
I love the app it's useful
nice good quality products with very cooperative response
I absolutely don t feel comfortable purchasing from new buyers on this app now. Alibaba the worst thing you could do is remove ALL reviews from the supplier profile. That used to help me and others determine if we wanted to shop with that supplier or not especially when our specific product doesn t have its own review
The app is really cool especially it shows varieties of equipment and products but my challenge is how to place an order and I need a low MOQ. In all you're doing a great job
Everything Perfect
Product appearance and packaging is very good. Customer service agent was excellent.
"easy to navigate, the suppliers are anxious to work with me."
Everything went well. Reliable and good business partner. We are happy to have found such a good supplier. Friendly and competent.
Everything...
We use Alibaba for locating product components that we require. We have never been let down. Excellent business platform.
Good business with alibaba
placing frist order is difficut.but when you met with reliable supplier it could do easy everything for you and i like alibaba trade assurance as well.highly recommended
I don't know what's worse.. the website or this app.. ugh. The biggest problem is sorting out all the spam without spending the rest of my life trying to do so.
India and China handicrafts .  Fast shipping by air .  Love love love
It has too many bugs. It does what it supposed to do.
"The platform offers a wide range of products and services, making it easy for businesses of all sizes to source products, connect with suppliers, and expand their customer base. Alibaba.com also provides secure payment options, efficient shipping, and excellent customer service. Overall, if you're looking to grow your business and explore new markets, Alibaba.com is definitely worth checking out. Amazing app to buy goods especially in bulk!"
Only waiting to see how the delivery system works after that great place for business....
Alibaba has everything which is perfect but shipping is very expensive . Wish we could get a better deal on shipping cost.
Nice oneb
"great program im used it for many goods and intrest on it
I buy my product from alibaba"
"The service is excellent and the products are great. The product I ordered was sent the next day despite the difficulties of the end of the year and arrived well packaged.
This is already a second order from the supplier and I highly recommend it"
"It is hard to place an order they ask for Zelle 
Money order how do I know is not a scam"
"The website is really user-friendly and you can find almost ererything. Might not be suitable for small order/quantities, depending on the products, but if you're planning/have an online shop, it's the website of choice!"
This is a quick and easy way to reach thousands of vendors to help manufacture your products.
"I have visited so many mini sites and everyone claims to be a manufacturer.  My recent experience of a purchase did not convince me that I dealt with a manufacturer. It s important that the info is authentic. We need to be sure of whom we are dealing with so that we can achieve our objectives. 

Alibaba has been useful but again, how do we enforce international warranties? We are about to make orders for items that vendor (can t call them manufacturers) are offering 3 years warranties. Also how do we see other customers review about a vendors product? 

Thank you."
the price n quality
"Products received in good time, all packed considerately and very well. Suppliers communication was excellent throughout transaction."
"You need better & cheaper shipping options if possible.  When the shipping is added I can buy things cheaper here in the U.S.  I know several people that feel the same way.  Would love to buy from you but the shipping cost are outrageous.  Just wondering if there is a cheaper way to ship it?? 
Thank you!!

"I extended the delivery. The order was 5 boxes, I received 2 on Monday, 2 on Tuesday and 1 on Wednesday. I got an email Tuesday saying We acknowledge that you are satisfied with the shipping information for the Trade Assurance Order 168715814001023230 (as you neither confirm the shipment nor request a refund within the given time period). I hadn't received everything yet!"
I don t know how to contact and how to buy things from your store
"Difficult to get cost on items.
Suppliers respond to odd items that I ve not even asked about.
Some have responded to inquiries I ve made about their items, cost and shipping information with nonsense or canned replies that have no relation to the question i asked them.
Order process is not straightforward or intuitive.
Overall not a confidence building experience.
All the above makes everything seem  shady  or worrisome that something criminal could happen with my payment information.

There definitely are items here that I want/need that are not available on AliExpress so I may continue to inquire until I find a supplier that gives confidence of a happy outcome but overall I just wish the item I seek was available from a supplier on AliExpress...I have many hundreds of dollars there and have had a 100% Good experience at there."
He understood the needs of buyers well and produced them with good quality products.
"First off, let me start of by saying that Alibaba DOES NOT ever step in favor of the consumer. I ve had many instances where I ve made purchases in verbatim details, as stated in the contracts, only to receive a much cheaper product or a different product than I had ordered. Not once has Alibaba sided with me. Second of all, shipping will take FOR EVER. The contract can state 2-3 weeks delivery and your products end up arriving months after(even if you paid for expedited shipping). If you are looking to get ripped off by both Alibaba and the sellers there, then Alibaba is for you. Be ready to lose money. ALIBABA and THEIR SUPPLIERS will RIP YOU OFF."
Does not give an option to remove debit or credit cards
Amazing and professional service and product quality was amazing High Quality Product
"The app is somewhat crippled, in that the developers buried some features.  For example, finding your favorites is not easy.  Sometimes features on the app seem to be absent.  

The website is better, although both the website and the app seriously overlook certain things. For example:

1.  You should be able to sort your favorites list by vendor, price, date, name, manually etc.  Just like any other search.

2.  On their messenger, and they have a little pop-up field where you can type in your reply. Unfortunately you cannot see the entire string. So if you have to refer back to previous messages while you were typing, you cannot do this. It s very inconvenient.

3.  I try to sort vendors using a folder for each vendor, but not all the named vendor folders appear, only the first two !

4.  I cannot easily load a cart to ask vendors for a quote on a range of items they are offering.  Alibaba s method is very convoluted; definitely unfriendly to the buyer.

I cannot imagine the complexity of writing an app such as this one. Although I sympathize, Alibaba is nowhere near as easy  for the buyer as eBay s website and app."
Great app. Easy to navigate. I have had great experiences working with vendors on Alibaba.
"I ordered three types of springs, they are perfect :)"
Hello Will you ever be thinking about getting after pay as an option to pay? You would have big sales!!! I know I would order a large amount of items from your store if my option to pay was Afterpay
Great app to connect with suppliers when you re actually looking for products to buy but the amount of unwanted spam messages based from browsing history is insane.
This app is full of counterfeit products. I got scammed for $240. Even after I let them know I would be reporting it for fraud I still didn t get even half of my money back. Be very careful the pictures are real the buyers seem fine they aren t.
"Jasmine Wu from Guangzhou Bonroy Cultural Creativity Co., Ltd. was wonderful to work with and answered all of my curly questions quickly. I love the book that was printed for me - it's beautifully made and very high quality. They also allowed me to use recycled paper."
Good apps for traders
"Good morning! I sent you several times mails to expose you my problem but so far no one reaches. I leave this message here by experiencing being read. I can not open my account from the application and the website. I have the installation and reinstall the app, but still no good news. It's urgent."
"Great application, just tried it. Looks very well done."
"I have to congratulate you, I have never received a product so quickly, I congratulate you, I hope it is a quality that will not be lost over time, taking advantage of this instance, I ask you if this delivery with this speed is for any product that I buy with you? .."
Anna Qiu is a profectional sale . she help us a lot in this deal. good job . we will stand together in future
"is ok, product is working"
"The product meets the expectations of quality and design. Very satisfied with the purchase. I will definitely buy again.
The supplier was very attentive and professional at all times."
"There is something for the whole family! I
Believe that you will love doing your shopping here"
Very bad ads show
"The communication was great, shipping was fast, and the items were exactly as described."
Great platform to find the right products to sell online.
"At first, I was so annoyed with this Alibaba, because I lost my money with one of the frauds which I found on the site, but since then now am happy because I was connected to good suppliers and most cases factory bosses. Now I can buy anything with no fear so long as I pay my money direct on-site {Alibaba site} not out of the site."
"I cant use the instant messenger. When I could use it, it's really bad. When I try to send a message the App kept trying to load. Then it would load and I would start typing again and then it would load again. Very frustrating. Please fix."
Love having this app on my phone for quick communication with suppliers.
"Ivy Wu, our manager performs so great and shifts our expectations every time we apply for any inquiries. Highest professional level, deep expertise and helpful attitude. Simply the best!!! Thank you, Ivy  "
Custom service agent is a bot (I do not mean Anna which tells you it is a bot) But when ask for chat with person this person is a bot.
"I recently purchased a cream from this company and I must say that I am completely satisfied with my experience. The cream itself is of very high quality and has worked wonders for my client's skin. I have noticed a significant positive feedback from my clients and i also recommend extra improvement to increase the use and quality more.

In addition to the quality of the product, I was also very impressed with the delivery service. The cream arrived promptly and was well-packaged, so it was in perfect condition when it arrived. The company also provided excellent customer service, answering any questions I had promptly and courteously.

Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and would highly recommend this company and their products to anyone looking for high-quality skincare products and exceptional service."
We used the payment link the supplier sent us and transferred the funds directly from our account. Aweek later the money has still not been received by the supplier and no one at alibaba is able to figure out where they are. Luckily it was just a small sample order but it just shows that you are still not guaranteed a secure transfer of funds when using Alibaba. Even with verified supplier.
I would like to get pictures of your kids clothing al of them I know that the virus has everyone stop from traveling. THANK YOU
"I could browse and chat with suppliers.  But could not get placing or paying for orders to work.

My advice: stick to the web site.   App is not quite ready for prime time."
I feel that I was tricked into thinking this was a better version of a different site and I am unimpressed with the products offered
Best online market place of the world.
"The APP IS SO SLOW and should have more shipping options to USA . those Chinese vendor,  They take advantage of us because we don t live in China and we don t know how much is the shipping rates over there, and they ask for shipping whatever TF they want... -_- They are asking for $79 shipping fees for a 3OZ sample. THATS CRAZY."
Horrible customer service I received horrible experience this app this a ripoff and it is unfair and not ridiculous don t waste your money my experience was the worst and I am a big online shopper just horrible
I hope they improve on this slow service
All the savings are incredible.
Excellent cooperation in solving shipping problems. Excellent quality of their products. High recommended to work with this manufacturer.
"Alibaba kept 230.00 of a 2800.00 transaction on a return from a China e-bike company
They also kept a portion from the e-bike company
Amazon has never done this to me in hundreds of transactions
First and last time I will use Alibaba"
"Always as stated, hardest part waiting for a average of 6 to 8 weeks ."
"Made a purchase few weeks ago and I received my purchase but once I took it to Freeman s  Car stereo to have it installed,, I received a call sayin the product wasn t good it doesn t work,, so I reach out to the seller. And they refused to give me a refund and refused to replace the items with items that does work"
"Amazing service, easy to use website. Fast delivery. Lovely supplier."
Great service
"Had a manufacturer produce a product way outside of the specs I requested. I couldn t use it. Then they wanted to charge me extra money to fix their mistakes. I told them I already paid and they needed to either fix it or give me a refund. They refused to fix it and wanted to either send me the useless bad product or refund a third of what I paid. I escalated the issue to alibaba. Alibaba felt that their offer to refund a very small portion was adequate. Like the Better Business Bureau, the take care of the people who pay them, not the consumers. They are only a pretend arbitrator."
"I placed an order on Alibaba for $3,312 from a seller named Beryl Lan of Xiamen Friendship Co. They tell me they can t ship through Fedex but send through Fedex anyway. Customs seized it because the seller didn t ship it with labels, needless to say I didn t receive my order alive or most of it at all. Seller offers 500 back out of 3,312. I open a dispute with atleast 30 pieces of evidence supporting the fact that my order wasn t shipped, nor shipped right and the dispute team decided that the seller wasn t in the wrong because the order was shipped. Even though they clearly didn t ship my entire order and lied to get away with it. This app and site are a joke. You can t dispute with the Chinese about Chinese sellers. Don t waste your time.....buy American and save yourself 2 months in transit!"
This is my first time with Alibaba I m hoping to buy a loader from China would hope to be a distributor it competition and free enterprise and should help to drivedown prices here in USA
"I ve shopped at several online jewelry outlets. This is by far one of the best, the quality is good and the prices are very competitive."
I was thinking this app is were I can make money from
Everyone is very responsive and its easy to find what you are looking for. My only gripe is that I wish the unit costs displayed were more accurate. I ve found that the unit price displayed is often not for the product they advertise but rather a their cheapest option. Makes it so you can only really get what your looking for after a lengthy conversation rather than click and buy and it s always more expensive than advertised.
I was amazed at how easy the app worked and how intuitive to operate.  Now to find out how responsive the sellers are!
"Some items I ve received through Alibaba have been exceptional, whereas others have been a disappointment. In preparing to purchase a costly item, I m trying to find a means to assure I m not disappointed."
"The app is great.  The ease of use, and the new style of the site make searching and responding to vendors easier."
Make their adverts concise without leaving any part thereof to be either misjudged or misunderstood
"Awesome resources for any business. Easy, fun and quick services. Thanks Alibaba!!"
"The product is well cast, with smooth edges. Pleasant contact with the manufacturer and the shipping went smoothly."
"Thank you so much for helping so much finding my new goods for my small business. 
XUCARDO"
"I purchased a product that never came, and I was at home waiting for the product the day it said it was out for delivery. I looked everywhere in case there was an issue. When i went back to the seller she was rude to me because i opened a dispute even though i never received the product. It took nearly three months and they said i didn t have enough evidence to prove that I didn t get my product since the shipping was shown delivered and it was my fault it was lost. Had to go to my bank to dispute the order and it s just been a hassle and a lot of money that I was waiting on. Make sure you ask them directly for shipping information because I feel like they aren t direct and try to confuse you with the wrong info. The customer service was very nice but they can t just not refund you when you don t receive your packages. I m just upset with the amount of time it took to get to this conclusion, i don t know if anything I order will make it to my house"
Love this everyone is so helpful and willing to assist
You put promotions as messages. These are NOT mesaages from people. It is an ad. I do NOT WANT TO SEE PROMOTIONS IN MY NOTIFICATIONS. I am sick of checking my app because it show I have a message. So I stop checking my account and get on less.  I am going to end up deleting my account if u dont stop!!!
"I think there should be a crack down on fraudulent photos... You the supplier didn t make the product, nor took the pictures then there s no way to claim rights to it!! No transparency and no consequence.. Buyer Beware"
"This app was fine in landscape on ipad, then after an update to the ipad now this app don t work in landscape. So everytime i have to write to the sellers i see the screen on it s side vertically. How am i supposed to write like that when i have my iPad with a keyboard case?? Please please fix this asap!!!!!!!"
I am new to this app but it seems incredibly interested  
I purchased 4 outboard motors from this comps and on the day of final payment I contacted this company to double check to c if they had my order .i sent my final payment excited to finally pay this off . The next day they said we don t have the order and now they tried forcing a pontoon boat on me with out my order I said no U lied about my motors ur lieing now about a pontoon boat and they want me to send another grand I said hell no I ask for a refund they don t give refunds this is my dealings with this company they still holding my 9000 against my will so I m stuck with them holding my 9000 dollars.  This could be u
Great communication and very patient while i waded through alternatives. Very happy with the end product!
"Like many companies now a days, Alibaba uses bait and switch to get what they want. Like offering you something  free  up to $88, for taking the time to fill out their survey. Once they ve got you to do the dumb survey, they reveal you get nothing what so ever free. They do offer you instead, several different trials of PAID NOT FREE products and trials. Of course if they were up front and honest about this, no one would ever waste their time doing it.  "
I look forward to buying more products.
Stuck in an error screen while ordering that cannot be exited out of even though there is an exit and close button. Horrible QA and testing of app.
"First i buy 100 wireless headsets,got package with fake item value not 289$ there is added 130$. Ir is problem for my country and package is sent back. Now i wait 14 days for my money seller no want to send me money back also alibaba support is so bad. That agent is so ugly and angry. I dont have now 419$ because i pay 220$ shipping, seller is not give me  reply on message. Never mind. Alibaba will get this negative feedback and also all people dont buy there . Buy on aliexpress or ebay !!!!!"
Every time I login it takes me straight to settings. I cannot get out of settings without logging out so then I login again and it takes me straight to settings. Very bad app.I went to their help menu and was told to clear the cash. So I went to the settings menu and cleared the cash. Then I couldn t get past the settings menu again without logging out.
"I like to deal with you as much as I can,thank you so much"
just made my first buy easy and was very helpful will buy from again ... ken
"Great platform, great supplier - overall great experience."
"Nice app for business purposes, but you need a review section for each manufacturer because some of these manufacturers are bogus and a waste of time"
It s a scam I order and luxury stroller and never received it it s been six months it took the money off my card I m so disappointed I want to sue this sight the could of just sent me something random 500 out the window

"The seller was very patient, helpful to give ideas and delivery time was very fast."
i ordered a phone it was meant to be a samsung S23 ultra what i got was a 10 year old cheap phone iv tried getting a refund but now they won't even reply to any of my messages
You can find everything on this app!!!! Love it!
"This was my first purchase from Alibaba, and I am VERY pleased with the entire experience! Shenzhen Angelina was super helpful when I initially reached out with a request for quote and additional information about the flower wall panels. I purchased this flower wall on 4/24 and received it in 2 boxes on 5/10 and 5/11. This is a set of 2, 8'x4' panels with the flowers and colors exactly as shown in the pictures. A few additional flowers were also included in my shipment in case I need to fill any gaps. I purchased this for my wedding in August, and I am so very excited to use it! Thank you! Overall I would say this is worth the purchase compared to renting at a similar price, or purchasing from other companies for twice the price. Very satisfied!"
"They had good pricing, a good product, and rapid production and delivery."
"From the word go, first approach to receiving products everything was very well done/calculated, very good quality"
"I am not pleased with your service . I had issues with my account , deactivate and signed back on ? And lost lost all of my contacts and current information on orders .
I attempted to contact your customer service center but didn t get any where with them . 
Right now , I have very little appetite to continue using Alibaba, as I no longer have access to my usual suppliers."
"Great prices and Chinese products are greatly improved in quality in last 20 years.
Only 3 things I don t like are:
1. Not able to zoom in.
2. The request for quotes on items.
3. Language barrier & time differences."
"A lot of interesting features that set Alibaba away from the norm.  Lots of interface to talk directly at super fast response time.  Would highly recommend to friends and co workers for businesses.  
Thank you!!"
Amazing app to get in touch with other businesses! Just started using and already loving the features! Thanks!
Superb App
I received personal and excellent service from the agent Karen Li. The product is professionally packaged and looks amazing!
Don t order anything from here. After you hear all the bad stories & testimonials thank me later
This is my second attempt to navigate the system. It is not intuitively obvious how to complete orders which apparently require communication with the seller. There is a certain level of frustration here.
We were able to bring both of our expertise together to create a great product. They provided me with many options and were able to put together my order with excellent quality!
"If you proceed placing an order with one of their sellers you will have to outsmart them, you will need everything in the quotation. Every little detail, that you would think, ""this goes without saying"", NO. It needs saying, like I want the stitching straight on my product, yes, you will have to discuss basic things with the seller. Check every little detail of your order, ask for everything to be added on the quotation, any special requirement you have, put it in writing. Because of course it will arrive wrong, duh. But at least the alibaba dispute team won't refute your case using that excuse. You asked for something, you put in in writing, then maybe they will refund your money if needed. I ordered using their platform, even though I did not receive a quality product and there were missing details I requested, they won't fix it or give me a refund. There can be stains, it can be broken, and it can be really really cheap, they won't assume any responsibility or fix the issue for you. PUT EVERYTHING IN WRITING if you still think its worth it."
Alibaba has the best supplies at the most reasonable price. Love shopping for bulk items and even single or double items here.
"good price but shippings are ridiculously expensive. for small businesses, pls do not go for this one. find alternative. this is for mega businesses, not for small businesses"
Great communication. Very responsive. Great client service
"The service is always great, and the quality of the product is very good. The product is delivered very quick using good courier companies."
Awesome and easy to understand
"Never buying again from alibaba, worst service. From Us, very bad customer service, no legal process through like eBay, no details and guarantees like insurance or legal terms."
"The product was shipped and received in a timely manner.
The DHL tracking was excellent, so you are rest assured."
"I purchased 45k usd worth of masks and they all came with damaged packaging and less than purchased quantity. Alibaba trade assurance means nothing. Seller is not willing to refund nor alibaba is doing anything to solve the problem. Now I m stuck with tons of mask that are not resealable condition for 6 months. Seller use bait and switch, as other reviewers said, once money is wired, they don t care, no after sale service.

Update:- the seller promised to ship shorted quantity and refund damaged boxes. After waiting for months without tracking, I contact alibaba again. The scam seller closed their account with alibaba and alibaba says they cannot do anything."
Great product. Shipped on time. No issues. Price was well under competitors in US
So far very professional
"Easy to browse, filters are nice to have to narrow products down a lot. 
  Some sellers descriptions and prices can be very misleading.  
   You have to be savvy when browsing and look at whose selling an item, a manufacturer, a wholesaler or trading company.  
    And knowing about the product when inquiring with seller helps lessen any confusion between you two.  
  Very happy with the companies I have worked with so far."
"App is good but the pricing issues are very random. Retailers have a range listed for each item, even on those that can be purchased as singles or samples.
Just put the ACCURATE pricing per unit on the APP and stop jerking us around."
They stick to time frames.They are honest on deals.
Very good service. Good quality. Delivered on time. Would do business again!
"I especially want to note the manager Della Qiu, she was very professional, she was always in touch, she answered all the questions very quickly. Everyone liked it very much!"
I can t believe EVERYONE doesn t know about or use this.  I m new to Alibaba but so far it is quite an amazing experience.  I m excited about learning more!
Easy
"Great shopping experience!
I will recommend this seller and Alibaba in general to my friends and family.

Best regards."
Alibaba is excellent! It enables you to complete projects and to get products you ve been wanting! The quality is superb!
best quality
gooddd
The Representative Seven Zhu is a very responsive and truly reliable person . I will continue to do future Business with her .
Most companies want to do business off of the app correct it s no buyer protections.
Every point from beginning to end was great. Very great!
I actually trusted them I took the risk of spending money on items I wanted and I ended up getting scammed and alibiba didn t get my money back or anything they are complicated because they only refund your money if you have a pc desktop or laptop and you have to do a lot of unnecessary things to proof you got scammed in the end I never got my money back and they let the scammer get away with a lot of money! If your reading this I ll do you a favor and tell you with honesty don t trust this app it s not worth it because this apps company s lets scammers get away with your money !!!!
"I LOVE Alibaba and shop off the site often. That being said, there is one MAJOR flaw. There is no bundle shipping option for sellers. Is this to drive traffic to AliExpress? Answers! Answers! Answers!"
Be careful when buying and assume anything you dislike will not be returnable.  Customer assurance program is a sham.  And they will always side with the seller.
"Good quality. Fast delivery. The seller is always in touch, responds quickly."
Nothing is priced correctly if something says it cost two hundred when u ask about it they go up almost three times that price and won t deliver to your address
The app is nice but the people and their shipping is outrageous they would be like you can get a bag for $5.55 and then you get 2 bags and they be like total is $600 total with shipping like... no then you try and negotiate and they just stop replying I haven t seen a person yet with shipping prices under $30 for 4 products something as small as 2 mini  $5  non hard bottom purses will cost $150 to get to you....no ma am............no ma am
Weare excited about our new set and cannot wait to add this to our beard set and introduce it our customer. The engraving is perfect.
working with trusted companies for years and never had a problem. great site for bulk orders
The payment options were easy and comfortable to use. I can trust when the operation includes Alibaba.com.
It s a horse and pony show with the app which is forced on you from the company.  After 10x trying to get to the mail area which just stalled so I deleted the app so I could get to the messages on the web site... well no it keeps bring me to the you need to download the app to work further even tho I deleted the app. So I can not get to my messages from an order I am trying to work on.  Which is a shame because a lot of good people are trying to do business through this app.  Maybe it s because of the weekend maybe not but this app needs a lot of work and this company needs to force this horrible app when it has a functioning web site.
Very nice and personable. Was very thorough in making sure they got every detail of my design and vision for the product. Was able to make all of my prototype colors for a really great and not expensive design fee. Communicated with me the whole way including shipping and confirmation of reciept. These bags are exactly what I wanted from design to finish! I'll be running a kickstarter to order as many as I can and we will be setting up a special unique zipper pull shape for them once I do so!
This is the best site in the world! It helped me create a clothing company and amass almost $2.5 million dollars! I was sitting at home wondering how can I get my clothes made? I don t know how to sew or had much knowledge about designing. I was sad. I wondered  how can I really get off the ground and build something great  but then liberty mutual called and I broke into my happy dance.
"Good interface, very intuitive app, the service alibaba is a great design to connect the manufacturers right to the businesses. No problems so far but I ve only had the app for four minutes so we ll have to see"
This app very slow in connection. Please upgrade server for the app.
"This app is great, I love that I can place an order from just about anywhere.  It s user friendly and it lets you save your favorite suppliers and favorite items and when you are ready you can quickly place an order from your favorites list or from an automatic  start order  list that appears when you go to one particular supplier... it will list and show all their items available based on your search details.  Very cool app, I love it..."
"The vendor was very helpful and understanding of my needs. I like that the vendor took her time to make sure I was pleased with the order. The order arrived on time but was not complete. So, my order I assumed it is still in process."
It s so hard to buy from your company it s almost not worth the time less the money you Might save.
"I ve been working with this app for a while and I haven t gotten a single thing ordered. I ordered my first item and the person told me the price was wrong although I had no way to change it myself after putting in all the information I wanted it set to. I asked multiple people questions before ordering and I didn t get any answers, one person replied with  hi  after I listed my questions and concerns and that was all. The app is fine with buttons and such although I have to close the app in order to open my chats and profile again. The people just make it difficult to purchase items."
"The products were exactly as described on your website, and they were packaged and shipped with care. I appreciated the timely and efficient manner in which my order was processed, and the delivery was right on time.
I must also commend your customer service team for being responsive and helpful throughout the entire process. Their assistance in answering my questions and concerns was greatly appreciated."
Excellent product. Outstanding service from quote to shipment.
They have great suppliers who offer the right products
The transaction was simple.
Salim And Mo top guys. Best place in Hitchin
I have received the phone I ordered but there s no place to put in a SIM card
I love this app for the fact I can easily message multiple manufacturers at a time. Although it is lacking in being able to filter the search results. I spend way to much time looking for the product mixed in with all other items.
"A truly wonderful experience I have with Alibaba. You can find just about all you need by looking it up on the site. The prices are more than reasonable and it s very enjoyable to browse through what you re interested in purchasing.
    Ronald Magistro"
"Web site is very busy and response time is a little . Also i dont see the secure lock on screen for the protection of transactions.
Os this site secure and does it come with guarantees?"
"Been trying to create an account for two days. Keep getting message ""System busy. Try again later."" I contacted their support after the first 7 hours. It's one day later but it's still broken."
"I spent two hours on this app trying to make a simple purchase. I tried to pay with a credit card and my payment failed and I wasn t sure why. After talking with customer service I found out that was because my card was going through a common security check. The customer service rep, Anna, could not tell me when I could expect the card to be done. This caused me to lose a discount on the purchase I was trying to make because it ran out of time."
"I love the purpose of the app however there s a few things that still needs fixing especially when using on the iPhone and iPad. It doesn t apply you to have full screen, I m constantly going on my browser to view messages between myself and the vendor because I m not allowed to view full screen."
Perfect
"I have had such good luck with the last vendor that I've gone back again and again. The process is a bit more than just making a purchase, but things have gotten more simplified with different vendors and I have branched out with different products and vendors. I have three orders now that I'm expecting as of 03/01/23. I really love this site."
Please add the option for customer reviews and photos
This is an amazing site.  Can t wait for this product!
"Alibaba is giving you a direct line to liars, cheaters, scammers and thieves. 
Yes, some are honest, but a lot are not and Alibaba will not help you, even with their buyer protection. 
The site is designed to make it easy to buy, but near impossible to resolve a problem. 
Not worth it!"
"Fast shipping, Quickness with which I find the products, very good communication with the suppliers, and easy navigation on the web."
"Most of the owner reply very late and does not provide a good necessary informations on their profile.
Wishing can shop with a good quality products with reasonable price."
Good product and reliable service from Alibaba again
"I have ordered many things, I run a small business with the discounts I get from alibaba. I would recommend looking at shipping costs and minimum order quantities. Those two things will get you what you want at a great deal."
"Hello, I am very angry with your antencuon, the truth is that I have 3 months that I Hello, I am very angry with your antencuon, the truth is that I have 3 months that I placed an order and I do not have it yet, but if they charged me, they are doing terrible service, it is a scam, I needed my shoes for my graduation and you did not look bad. laced an order and I do not have it yet, but if they charged me, they are doing terrible service, it is a scam, I needed my shoes for my graduation and you did not look bad."
To pay using trade assurance is TERRIBLE! it doesn t allow card to be used... checking or anything... I ve had to use wire transfers ALL the time. And it isn t easy.
"Hello, We have very good understanding, good quality products and general very good collaboration."
"Easy to use site, gives companies the opportunity to do business with ease."
I like it what is the price
Too complicated to buy wholesale
I am happy that my order arrived even though it was a small quantity
"Aloha I have been a huge fan of Alibaba over a decade. . .Could be the Worlds best company, definitely the best as far as I am concerned. . .Highly recommend for types of materials and laser equipment . . ."
I would like to place orders on a lot of things but I can t seem to get through to anything or anybody that can do anything for me to place orders I would like to order a whole lot of things is there anybody out there that can help me thank you
"This was my first experience ordering from Alibaba. I had many doubts about the payment and quality. But the supplier was very helpful and answered all my doubts. Communicated with me frequently to answer all queries. Shared images before dispatch. The order was delivered on time. The quality was good as expected.
The collection of products of Alibaba is endless, you wish for something and you will find it there. Do your due diligence about manufacturer and make payments inside Alibaba to avoid fraud and you are good to go.
The only issue I faced was that, I prepaid the order and shipping cost to the supplier still I was charged the extra amount in the form of customs duty and service charge, of which I was not aware. I was expecting that it will be included in the shipping fee, as the supplier confirmed the same. Seems the supplier was also not aware of the charges, so I would advise checking about the charges in the form of customs duty and service charges at your destination port as they are not included in the payment you will make to the supplier on Alibaba. But the supplier cooperated with me in investigating the extra charges. In the end, the product quality was good and communication with the supplier was very smooth. Hence the extra price is acceptable. I would recommend Alibaba for your business or personal use purchases."
"Ordered a sophisticated, programmable electronic gate lock from One Lock from China through Alibaba. Gave it to my locksmith with 40+ years of experience to install and was told it came with absolutely no assembly, install, or programming instructions. He could not do anything with it until he did. Rep for supplier lied repeatedly after multiple requests for instructions and said they were being sent, and never arrived. Finally sent me a 90 second video IN CHINESE. Still no programming info. I started a refund request and supplier refused to accept return or give full refund of $150. Alibaba got involved and was not helpful in any way. I had screenshots of all communications and the short Chinese video. Supplier agreed to $100 refund then apparently changed their mind- Alibaba said they'd give me $60 back and a $40 Alibaba credit. Finally filed a dispute with Visa. Avoid Alibaba and One Lock like the plague- they are crooks."
Only place to find hard to find stuff with a professional attitude.
"Too many choices. Needs more filters. Materials need to use standardized materials and terms. I.E., shiny black is not a material."
"I,been looking for something large pre- built and taken apart for shipping."
It s a lot of delays you have to open the app to see if you have a message sometime you don t get your messages until you open the app. Sometimes you hear it go off and noting will pop up. I have to refresh several times because i know there s a message waiting there.
A great source to go to for bulk product at a great price.
"Good communication, friendly, quality, Service, and confidence. Thanks"
Buying direct from whoesalers is something I ve always been down with shopping at Costco and bargain market if you re gonna buy bulk this is the way to do it!
I downloaded this app to write a review on something disgusting I saw this morning an add with a child clearly underaged in a swimsuit with the name under saying  sexy kids bikini.  Who ever chose to use that word marketing children s swimwear needs to be fired or something. I reported the add but I still have a screenshot for proof. I m sill very unsettled.
You added some teacher to ask people questions about themselves so you know them better. Understandable. But when you re doing the featured the next button is off of the screen so you can t evem navigate the app. So I can no longer use the app because I can t move past this part. Very terrible. Unacceptable.
Excellent app.! Everything is done in seconds!
Did the latest update have bugs? I m now unable to view orders or purchase from shopping cart after installing
Good app
"Hi I purchased a car radio which was faulty ..
The supplier and Alibaba were unhelpful. What a waste of money.
Do not use these guys as there is no help for the consumer after the purchase.
If I could give a zero rating I would have ..
One of the worst experiences in my life , also spent a lot of time on the computer to reason with them, to no avail."
"Today I get package everything okay with it, thank you very much and specially thanks to Zhou May, she superb did all the work and explanations on purchase and supervised the shipment Thank you Zhou May.
 "
"ali baba is so bad actually because it is a Chinese application, and its things are not original the quality is bad, and the seller could hack you and he is protected with ali baba it may seem to you good because of the prices but they will make you pay more than the written number believe me they are Chinese fake bad sellers."
Why is there no phone number to make a phone call to somebody and find out what s going on and how to order the equipment and answer some simple questions so frustrating
"Please fix can adding china address by chinese word,thank you"
This isn t for any supplier but the messenger needs to be redone because it s hard to see and communicate when you can t read the whole conversation because of how it s halfway set up. Please fix this ASAP
"I am satisfied with goods
I received what I expected"
"I am very much impressed in trading and making payment which was easy and beyond my expectation more over i felt that my payment is safe.
Regards
Jenson"
Great service and received exactly what was on the description. Seller was very communicative and checked with me to make sure I get what I needed. Thank you.
"Service, speed, clear answer what more could you ask for."
"It s hard to navigate on here and you need to be like AliExpress and have a checkout pay now button to purchase and be done,This is a horrible experience.I have gotten any good help yet."
"This app is now flooded with horrible suppliers. The amount of crappy products makes finding any good suppliers almost impossible. 
Plus numerous suppliers which after a couple of days or even weeks of communication will want to either use PayPal as payment over alibaba or alter your deal. I have been using AB for 2 years now and am switching to Global Source or just Google searching. Seem to have better luck finding seriously suppliers. 
Alibaba has abandoned looking out for its buyers."
Service was efficient and professional. Delivery arrived ahead of time and the product was great quality and exactly as we ordered.
It is one of the best app but i only can do the payment through the atm
Seller has Best Response and Give Fast Delivery
Fascinating
"So far so good, good products great communication and fair prices. No complaints. Just a big thank you!"
"I love it, it's to get in contact with sellers and develop a business relationship, I couldn't be happier or ask for anything better."
"If you re a small business owner and you re not this app and website, you re failing yourself altogether."
"I always fine the products needed for my different technical practices or even for disperse, thank you

Memodaman"
Just downloaded the app for my iPhone. I love it. It s really easy to use and I can stay in touch with my suppliers at all times.
Easy to order. The delivery date is faster. The products are beautiful
Working on shoes business
"the fact that the company was always willing to inform me and walk me trough all the process from beginning to end, supplier and customer service form alibaba.com are 5/5"
It makes it easier for me to setup my wife little jewelry startup
Ali baba awesome a website.. safe and trusted.. it s a global international huge  cheap market ! 
"The importation of goods is a lengthy process. Although I explained to supplier it was my first time using app, and I needed all documents and information to successfully complete the transaction. They don t care. They ACT like they care, they make you think they are helping. They will take your money and disregard important things like giving you correct documentation to actually file US customs paperwork. They will ship that item and leave you with the fines. FINES! I never even received proper paper to take action until after it was too late. Completely their fault. They don t care. Thanks China. Should have known better."
Some fake suppliers & Some honest suppliers. Make sure you are in a safe trade before any payment
"Good cooperation, helpfull"
Easy to navigate and use
I ve been wanting to add a new card on this site to use for future purchases but I m unable to do it!
"Alibaba is the best supply store I've got on in a while, I give it a 5 star rating because I've been a long time buyer and haven't had any problems yet."
The ease of the process and the shipping options
Always had good exprience with Alibaba only once I got broken machine & trade asssurance did not work but let say in general you can trust them eyes closed
The supplier is very friendly
"My company European Connection Furniture is in business for more than thirty-five years. I brought and shipped hundreds of containers and other goods
From the Alibaba website my search for a freight forwarder I choose one with a pretty competitive rate from his reply to my ad on the Alibaba platform. This particular shipper has excellent reviews published on Alibaba's website and then I decided to ship my factory-ordered goods to the shipper's warehouse in Shenzhen to be shipped to my address in the USA. After the goods were delivered to the company warehouse on October 30, 2022, the shipper increases the shipping rates more than 4 times from the original quote and demanded that I send money without any security to his private account without any invoice from his side. I had hundreds of chats with Alibaba customer service for more than 3 months but they finally refused any help to me, claiming that I need to go direct to the party for any solution. I later found from other complaints websites that this forwarder scammed the same way many other customers in the past and feedback from these customers was not allowed to be placed on Alibaba. For more than two months I was begging Alibaba to let me access the website of the shipper to place just a review about my experience and warn some other potential customers about their practices. Alibaba refused to place my feedback on its website of this particular supplier even after a phone conversation with the manager of the customer service.
It looks like all scammers and fraudsters on the Alibaba website are receiving full protection from Alibaba and customers like me are arrogantly ignored by the company. The reason is probably that they receive a commission from the advertisers and not from the customers. Four and half months have passed and my order is not shipped. I would like to advise all customers of Alibaba not to look at feedback placed on Alibaba websites because they are manipulated by Alibaba policies and are not trustworthy at all."
connected me with a trustworty business happy to use alibaba have done about 5 trades and turn out to be legit.
"It is so frustrating that the supplier need to review the review I left so that they could filter their reviews. But please don't order in this supplier: 
DALIAN ZM INTERNATIONAL TRADE CO.

honestly, my expectations are not meet. First, my physical product, I ordered the one that has a compartment for the eyeliner. I have received it separately from the eye lashes. Second, they are over priced. Hear me OVER PRICED, you just need to explore different vendors in this app and obviously they overpriced. Third, I was told that my package will be shipped the 8th of April, then I follow up they gave me a tracking number on 16 which is more than a week of their promised date. But turns out it really got shipped 28th of April. Fourth, I don't understand about the delay of Shipment because of COVID, I stopped believing this excuse when my other orders got here when I ordered first from them. Lastly, it is super disappointing when they have promised for FREE products for the inconvenience but freaking TWO MAKE UP REMOVER WIPES for all the hassle? No, this is just ridiculous."
Easy to get quality quotes from quality suppliers. Easy to use. No commitment expected or required
Alibaba has worked as advertised for me. Great products. Great service. No problems.
"I have bought a printing machine for $2000 and the supplier replies so lazily and they are not even letting me get a refund. And when I applied a refund through u guys, u all just neglected it. Even Rn I tried contacting him on his business hrs time and still didn t get proper replies. Supplier name Henry Xu"
Placing my order was easy and thorough. The customer service was exceptional. The number of available products and vendors is endless. The only grievance I have is the difficulty in changing account details.
This app is great ad is good
I love this app because I can buy thing way cheaper than the real price. It is very nice! Lots are free shipping! I hope this app encourages others!!
Love this
Alibaba is one of the best apps and places to purchase any item your looking for with the best prices ever on this planet .
"I wanted to take a moment to express my appreciation for the excellent & secure services you provided.

Overall, I am very satisfied with my experience with Alibaba and will not hesitate to recommend to others. Thank you for your exceptional service."
Prompt response from salesperson. Quality product.
There are always mistakes or inconsistencies in the product descriptions.
Seller is ver knowledgeable with audi products
"This app is not friendly for iPad users. It only displays one way and that is in the format for a phone. Love the app, but need to be able to use it on iPad. I like to use my iPad landscape mode and this app doesn t allow me to do that."
"This app while it may be great for sourcing products and taking your money customer service is nonexistent trade assurance program is a joke.. I made two purchases first one went relatively smooth, except for they forgot to ship half my order and lead me on for over a year about my refund that I still never received. And the second one was bad right out the gate. Never received my purchase nor given status updates as to his whereabouts this lesson cost me upwards of $8000 in total .Sellers are allowed to sell counterfeit goods and commit blatant fraud without any repercussions. Alibaba will not stand by you to help you get your money back. Whole thing is a big fat expensive joke Buyers beware I warned you."
I purchased barbershop equipment because I thought it would be cheaper I ended paying double the price at the end when they started charging me extra shipping cost port charges warehouse fees I m really upset will never buy again and will spread the word about this scam
You can lean how to put your collection together like window shopping
Alibaba takes customer support and customer experience to a completely different level. The services and options provided by Alibaba simply have no match in today's market and that is why I source as much as possible through them.
Tells me that I already have an account when I try to sign up. Then try forgot password and it says I don t have an account. Go figure.
Great app for buying for a resale business and buying in bulk!
A global trade always available and easy to use for everyone
I purchased several items from various vendors it s hit or miss with deals once you include outrageous shipping. Two separate machines I purchase did not work arrived broken and they will not replace not even a simple part. Both broken items could have been replaced but they would not. I was scammed by the communist owner of the app not from the workers under this  regime.
Great Service. I m from America and this service from the vendors here are spot on!
"Haven t received my first order yet, but I have been happy with the communication and service so far by the manufacturers I have worked with."
Love this system:) easy to use .
Just find it a bit confusing.
Many times the app continues to lock up as you re typing a message. Everything freezes and I have to wait.
I m starting my lash line and this has been such a pleasure working with alibaba I m finding out so much quality over quantity
"Alibaba support is not on your side, they will make up arguments and will protects Chinese suppliers, after seller shipped low quality and damaged product."
"fast reply, easy to communicate and professional"
"the shipping price is too expensive to go to Malaysia, how can we buy goods online from Alibaba.com if the shipping price is too expensive"
I love this app very informative and help to promote the business
Bob Wilson is always great to deal with. He responds quickly to questions and follows up with any issues from suppliers. The only problems I have had have been in delays in recieving products... which is more of a supply issue than anything Bob has done.
This app has many problem to browse it. i can't smoothly use this app. bad experience.
"Trade assurance seems to only work in favour of suppliers!

I ordered twice from them and will never attempt to do so again. The first time I ordered custom chairs, for 1,200 CAD. When they packed the chairs, they put the metal legs against the back of the chairs, ripping them completely. I complained to the supplier, they told me to pay extra for material and they will send it to me and I can have someone here fix the chairs at my own cost. Which worked out to 400 per chair plus the additional cost of material!! Insane! I opened a claim with PayPal, they didn t respond and waited for the claim period to expire so they don t do anything about it. My money was lost! Two years later I decide to try another supplier for another item, the supplier tells me to make a payment and he will ship within two days of the payment clearing, and charges me transaction fee. A week later he messages me telling me it s out of stock and to request a return. I said I will wait he then said it will take two weeks and that I must cancel and re order. I didn t agree, then he came back saying in 2 months the item will be available. I said I will wait, then he said well actually a year. Clearly he was playing around and did not have any stock and had no intention of sending the item. When I complained to alibaba they assured me that if I cancel my transaction fee will be refunded, I took a print screen of the conversation. Guess what, the refund did not include the transaction fee! I complained again to alibaba they said sorry u cancelled, I explained again what happened they stopped talking to me. This time I called PayPal and showed them evidence. They are scammers do not buy anything from them. There is no such thing as trade assurance for anyone outside China for them!"
You guys make way to much to have such a bad quality app for IPads I can t even visit profiles. Once you click  the profile the website screen zooms in and freeze  
"A marvelous all-under-one roof market place  love it! """
Three thumbs up
The product was exactly as advertised and the company is extremely responsive and trustworthy!
"I love this site, the only reservation I have, in general there is not a clear detail on how the sales are done from begging to the end. I am talking about the small details that every shopper would need to know, from the way of communication to the clear way of payment and recourse, to shipping to the final destination, I have been trying to make a purchase for a long time but feeling I am walking in an unknown territory."
I bought 2 items from them never got anything I wrote to them they answered saying they sorry  but never got my money back or the items scammers
"This app is so difficult to use and understand I still haven t been able to order what I want... 3 weeks after downloading!

Multiple illegible conversations that always dead-end with me not able to order my rooftop tent."
"Very very very third class things. 
Show me different things send me different very very bad experience. "
"Very good online platform for all kinds of sourcing.
Great transparency of prices."
Sansan Lu provided great customer service. I received my order in just 2 days! I highly recommend her!
i use to order tons of stuff from here about 5-10k a year worth of merchandise. I ordered from a seller and the package got lost (first time this ever happened). Alibaba refused to refund me saying it wasn t the sellers fault the package was lost which I did understand however the seller filled out the shipping form wrong so I couldn t even file a claim with the shipping company to get my money back for the lost package so I ended up losing the money & got no merchandise. I ll never use this app again.
This is one of the best app ever thank you so much for your help and time Amen!!!!
So basically i was just shopping for one thing till for some reason the shipping fees were 99 dollars which is wack because i just wanted a small plush
"Crashes a lot. Like a bad weed, once you create an account it is impossible to delete. They continue to send junk mail after unsubscribing to all notifications. The website is not any better. On iPhone and iPad it says  Invalid parameter  misspelled."
"China will not ship what should I do about it and I m out $28,000 that is poor business from China to United States cannot retrieve wire transfer to China Wells Fargo gave up on me so Alibaba is that all you do is keep the money and run
From Martin Lenzen 1608 South Highway 13 Creighton Nebraska"
Great jobs
Not easily search for particular items
Super friendly people......and all the product is good....specially their customer service
"Very friendly, and compassionate towards their customers. Their quality is also the best. definitely going to come back for more business with them!"
"Warning! Buyer beware! Don't buy from

""Yiwu Zheweijin E-Commerce Co., Ltd.!"" Seller!

You may proceed at your own risk with the rest.

if you place an order with this company, they can immediately be blocked on chat and all other sources. The company profile has all the incorrect addresses.
You can't request or make it clear about your order before it ships from the seller.

I have all communication proof from the seller and Alibaba.

I can't see how to attach these proof details here, but I will try to post them in other places, and I will create a YouTube video to alert all Aliba new buyers.

Alibaba silently supports sellers, not buyers. Alibaba ignored its own trade assurance policy to make sellers happy because sellers pay more than buyers.

I have found Trade Assurance to be greedy for buyers only.

I will explain this in detail in my upcoming video, including how to protect yourself and where and how to buy Chinese products.

The video title would be not sure 100% now = Trade Assurance with Alibaba does not exist in reality, and customer service works like a poppet."
"aweasom, this is my second time purchase here."
Great app so far simple to use
Poor app. The least user friendly I use.
"Extremely pleased with first purchase!  Saved $2,000!"
"very good communication, and people are very helpful."
It's a very useful app
little delay on logistics but had great feedback and attention from seller
this company makes excellent rims. The design of the product is very good. I want to have a lot of users
Really very satisfied with the products received that without surprise conform to those ordered. I am very satisfied with the quality of the products I received and I would recommend this supplier.
Your website is very well designed; chats available and quotes always ready.  Thanks.
I have to say that this is a God sent. It has provided me the opportunity to find quality goods and vendors. The app itself does everything it is supposed to do and much more than I could ve thought of. P.S. It just keeps getting better all the time!
"I would like to start off by saying all the sellers and customer service on this app have been amazing.

A few weeks ago, my account was suspended without any warning for a supposed spam violation by Alibaba s AI. I found out this was because I sent my logos/designs to many suppliers who asked to see them, but unfortunately this action caused my account to be flagged as a high-risk account. I ve contacted customer support twice over the matter but was unable to recover my account. I ve lost contact with all my suppliers, which was problematic as I had already put down some hefty orders. 

To future/current users, please be careful and make sure you have a backup of your supplier s contact info."
"Excellent customer service, goods just as described"
Your app is not user friendly!!  One cannot even move from the settings to the main page with ease. There s no option to click to get out of the settings or even close the settings!!
This is an amazing app for any retailer who wants to purchase items at very cheap prices (mainly from China). My only problem with this app is that since almost everything is from China shipping can be crazy for even small items to the US. Shipping fees account for more than half of my total expenses on this app as a buyer. Lower shipping costs would make this a lot more convenient and give me more options to pick from.
"Overall, Alibaba website is poorly managed!
Looks like Chinese stuff!"
"Great service.
Delivery was delayed because of Chinese Holiday but you provided a credit and eventually the product arrived and I was very happy with the quality."
"The fact that we were able to use Alibaba for our payment definitely made dealing with a new supplier easier and gave us added confidence. The professionalism of Tony in arranging everything meant that overall we had a great experience. The monitor we purchased was delivered not only on time but 1 day earlier than expected and the monitor being exactly as promised made us a very happy customer.

James @ RJB Trading Ltd."
Like the app easy to navigate!
"Beautiful products , and very helpful"
So far it is an excellent platform to explore new ventures. I would suggest if Ali Baba encourage small buyers to make regular purchases by giving them discount or payments on instalment that it could not only boost the buyers but it could also increase profitability for Ali Baba as well.
"Too hard to get basic info. Master pack size / weights / specs aren t easy to get. Never sure what is specifically being offered, and no way to see all items offered by a supplier. Pages slide by suddenly, lots of fancy design elements, but not helping buyers find what they need -"
Wow Its really best for business but the frieght cost is high .. Any how i give it 5 *****
"Exactly what the title says. Coincidence? I think not. Very shady that you can t turn off the notifications for the incessant Promotional messages, although there s a toggle for you turn it off (but doesn t work)"
"This was my first order with Alibaba and I must say I was very suprise with the quick shipment, the quality of the product and most importantly the willingness that Alibaba gives to assist the buyers with any issues before, during and after buying."
"With Alibaba, I was able to find a supplier who brought my idea to life and one that I can build a relationship with."
Ali baba have everything you want from A to Z
I do clothing manufacturer business. I got many support for this. Thanks
Very responsive and great follow up throughout the ordering process.
So far so good haven't encountered any problems
Great!
Excellent and easy app to find providers
"Terrible service can not communicate with a

"Having purchased over the past 9 years on here this company has proven consistency with all the products we use. Easy to relay our needs and replies that feel like you are talking to someone real and not copy paste translation. They have fulfilled many orders and we will continue to do business with only this company. Fast payment links, fast shipping in Fedex or DHL hands with proper Customs documentation to insure speedy delivery. Happy customer :)"

Has everything I need.
Be more compact !!
This app is  its own world for the sellers. Lots of thievery. This is the only way they communicate so if you don t keep your app open Al day everyday- your subject to paying for items you will NEVER get. Don t trust it.
"Alibaba is great way to buy, sell, Distribute or develop any product at any level."
"I love this app and what it can help you with. Some vendors are rude and take long to respond but you will never come across a business with each employee with perfect customer service, no. Overall a great app."
Best sellers in the world friendly and ready to assist
all is fine thanks for all good comunication good products fast delivery
The host with usually the most.
"excellent platform, great products and great suppliers so far has been my experience. Thank you very much. Regards. Juliet."
There should be a specific prices of items. Especially cars!
"I do not think it is very friendly so far.  I may get use to it, but for now it is very ???.  I would like to be able to click on a product and see details right away. Can this be done"
From the minute we started with the design of the mug to the finished product - they were great. Helpful in each stage of the process. Could not have been better.
This is a complete scam. They had me make so many changes to receive my ordered products yet I haven t received them by the time they stated. The products also say they have been delivered to another state. Don t trust this online scam!
Best way to do Business with your kind help!
the best
"This company is very good, speacially my contact person named Lucky, she is a very good customer assistant. I would recomend her to the world"
I see a lot of people use this app and they get very help
"For today s complaint. I had purchased some clear transparent epoxy resin and Hardner from  maidaofu  at Foshan madoff chemical Co ltd. 

I showed her pictures of what I was doing and that I also would be using transparent pigment to color the transparent epoxy. She never once told me that she was sending brown Hardner. Literally the color of coffee. 

When I addressed her about this, she told me that I asked for Brown which is a lie and added me to the blacklist instead of communicating or sending me to her boss to communicate

In our messages, I clearly state that it needs to be transparent and this is utterly ridiculous having her tell me that she was not made clear requirements.

 I need them to be contacted, they need to send me CLEAR Hardner to fix the improper product that they sent."
"Good service, good products, good price"
Alibaba is connecting consumers and manufactures. I have explored the platform inside out and I am impressed with the technology and philosophy of Alibaba.
This is a great app with great site and possibilities only caution is to do business within the app for additional security measures
"Fantastic site for finding suppliers for a new business. Started a business and had to find a supplier, had many options and could easily get samples. Easy to use too."
"Some deals to be found, but when using the app on iPad, or even in the browser the images are too large, fonts get cut off. Jumbled clunky user interface. Needs work. Even selected desktop website, with not much difference."
Pictures are not uploading on the app. Most 95% of pictures or videos won t upload. This is a new issue cause never had these problems before so please get it fixed. There s nothing more aggravating than trying to look at a picture and it will not upload. And it s not my phone because every single other app is just fine. And i ve done it with and without Wi-Fi as well. Still not working.
I am not a seller but a customer and I wish to purchase some of these shoes. Please let me know where I can get them.
"The overall interaction with the website is easy to use, clear and helpful to get along with suppliers.
Everything is made to give you the easiest experience and give you the best chances to make your trades work."
There were transport issues that were out of the senders control. However Darrell was very good at consistently following up with it all the way until it was delivered. He is very professional and a valuable asset to his business. Thanks.
"Do not trust trade assurance. Most suppliers know that they can either steal your money and provide false tracking or send you a load of junk and the claim takes forever to resolve, if it gets resolved. Good platform to support those two activities. I have found 2-3 good suppliers out of 12... that's just not good odds for business."
first order was sent to another buyer. Second order in process still pending. 6 weeks started
all suppliers that I have used or spoken with are very polite and knowledgeable with their products
Fast and reliable service and product was satisfactory.
The option to turn off promotion notifications is not working properly. They keep sending you notifications for promotions constantly.
"I used Supplier: Yolanda Tinana | No. 172302367501027197 whom had good ratings and a long time on this platform and good but ( fake) reviews .. so all the home work i was supposed to do before sending payment.
i used Trade assurance as recommended
when i reviewed the contract it was good units ordered were correct... but when it was sent to my email i noticed the supplier lied about shipping cost and quoted me express price for standard service

so this is bad business on day one... i decided i didn't trust them to fulfill my orders as the already showed no professionalism and i cancelled my order
you must then apply for a refund and i did ....somehow they closed out stating we reached a resolution ( with out any talks of such resolutions) and trade assurance refunded me 5$ a tiny fractional amount of what i sent - i lost hundreds ....once i requested the refund i noticed the contract emailed to me was not as my order detailed - they were incredibly fraudulent"
It s terrible they even stole $110 no matter what they always believe the person who u get the item from even when u have proof I ll use AliExpress before this
"I am very satisfied with the product and your customer service,
Specially my contact Aimee Lee"
I don t understand why people have to order so much at one time the first time ordering anything from them. Then they expect you to pay so much for something you never ever seen or touched in real life. I just want to know why?
"Can I know who make this app?? Very stupid and very hard to Oder something,, when I m start to Oder system say will chat with the supplier first and when I chat the supplier ,, I wait for one month for supplier reply my chat!!! Very stupid!!! If u do business like this no more customer download your app!! Seriously WTF"
"Sometimes you win sometimes they will get you for all your money. I had better product service with the unverified sellers than trusting alibaba trade assurance. Literally a scam, what the seller says goes. There are so many people using this app they don t care about true customer service. Once I order 4 things and one item was completely wrong. I asked to return it for a refund and they only granted me 5% of my money because they didn t want to pay shipping for return and alibaba wouldn t make them refund the item. I purchased a pricier item, waited 4 months for my product, and still haven t received it or a refund. There is no guarantees only use this site if your willing to gamble with your money"
Everything is super high quality. Great service and excellent customer service. I highly recommend this supplier. Bella is amazing. And shipping was Fassst!!!!
I bought an Ezrevo robotic mower from Alibaba Supplier Mark Li. I never received the product and since last July 2022 he has not refunded me the 472 euro. Last month he said only 300 euro refund and now he is saying 100 euro and that I didn't send back the shipping agent details which I did numerous times. Do not do business with Mark Li
"Everything was great, thanks for your cooperation!"
Horrible! This site is just horrible. I received my shipment over two months late and they didn t even send me everything I ordered. They denied my dispute and now they are ignoring me. Very bad business.
The app is quite good
"App has had the same issues for years, they never fix but charge high fees.

I can t click out of messages from the DM."
Very helpful and friendly customer service. Fast shipping. One of the best buying experiences I've had on this site
"On-time Shipment, Very satisfied, Supplier Service Very satisfied, Easy to communicate & understand, Friendly & helpful, The order was fully compliant, Willing to resolve issuesVery professional"
I have been using Alibaba for many years and everything is great about it
"Please can you tell us how much they cost cuz I want the price and I love your app it is the best app. This app can ship to IRAQ ??

Thank you 
Your sincerely"
Easy to use for anyone trying to expand your business and helps you communicate with people all over the world!I think it's fantastic!
"Good app, easy to navigate and lots of info."
Oh nice
At first it was very confusing but now overall its a good app
"They deleted my older messages. By the looks of it, they only keep messages within the past couple months."
Ordered items and have waited over one month and still have not received the items. Trying to cancel my order and get my refund of my money and they will not give me back my hundreds of dollars. Stay far away from this app.
"This looks very interesting.  Another source for hard to find products.  If my first transaction goes well, I will continue using and change rating to 5 star."
Good App
"This is very important to deal with professional people that care I was very satisfied and will continue to do business in a daily basis. Thank you, Luis. Great Rep!"
"The app is out dated, slow and needs to be revamped. I ve also experienced adverse response dealing with Trade Association. I was scammed out of 7k US dollars by the Yang Yang company. A vendor should never want to keep the full payment after 48 hours of payment submittal without providing service/product. In addition to that I have had Trade Association employees respond to me who can t write or speak proper English which poses a barrier. You must also be careful bcuz some Trade Association reps are bias due to being friends with some of the vendors. Please make sure you vett the company s sales, leadership team, and quality of the products."
"Please help me. I could not find anyone to ask. I complained but nobody replied me . I wrote this message to Ms. Carlota Li, Sales CEO of SUDUDA Changsha Speed Da Import And Export Co., Ltd. but she did not do anything to solve! this was my message: Please read all our conversations with Bonnie Liao from SUDUDA Changsha Speed Da Import And Export Co., Ltd., and Alice Liao From Crown Logistics. Two different names, but the same person! She trapped me. She picked up my goods from the factory, asking $ 60 for picking up and a total price $529 for everything in shipping. After she weighed my goods she asked for $1309 exaggerating the goods' weight. I did not accept her offer and wanted to find a new shipping company. She did not return the goods to me and asked Storage fee: 976*0.1*7=683.2USD
Loading and unloading fee: 120 USD
Documentation fee : 50 USD
pick up  100USD
Total Tatol: 683.2+120+50+100=953.2usd By the way, I could not reach her most of the time, and she never informed me about storage ad other fees. I understood it is a trap but it was too late I accepted her shipping fee but this time she refused to place the order on the alibaba page! she wanted I to pay to her bank account number!ofcourse I did not trust on her I said first she has to place the order on alibaba page but she does not accept and kept my goods. She is not a normal person please search and read our conversation. I need your help, please!How can she ask storage fee without informing about giving up rules before picking up my goods from the factory?It is not ethical. I am in a trap.I said her to read every line of our conversation to see the trap. She read but did not do anything to solve the problem. So I LOST $1479 MY GOODS FEE WHICH I PAID TO FURNITURE COMPANY!
AYDINOL"
The people on this app contact you very fast
Unbelievable
"There are great people on there to do business with. But it s difficult to tell who is telling the truth. I ve had some make claims that were not in the sales agreement. So if it s not in the sales agreement you have ZERO recourse through Alibaba sales protections. 

For instance one company claimed the merchandise was ready to ship, just needed to put labels on the boxes. It was time sensitive so I paid them not realizing the sales order gave them 90 days to ship the product. Turns out they were short on supplies to complete the order. By the time it shipped I thought they were not going to. They claimed I needed to call customs but the shipper did not call. By the time I called upon their insistence, I find out it was returned to the shipper in China. They got my money and the product. Alibaba did ziltch because is was in their sales contract. It didn t matter that they lied to me which I proved by supplying the text threads. That didn t matter. So BUYER BEWARE !!!"
The organization made small business owners able to operate the App software easily and made shopping for goods user friendly.
Everything that I need is in one big marketplace. Excellent!!
"Thx 4 great prices and app set up... i hope it s not a set up lol cuz I want that bike for a G ! Wow and electric! :) Lemme take it for a real spin :) I never rode one because my idol was  Evil Kanival now it s God lol. Thank you   Alibaba 
God Bless "
Its really friendly user and the item sell inside here also attractive... all i needs is inside Alibaba
"Very Business promoting website, all suppliers on this platform"
They are very active to respond to costumer
#NAME?
I love saving money with Alibaba
Easy and straightforward to do business with
Wawwww it's nice shopping place
I cannot switch my account business to personal use! How could i do that?
fast and confident with trade assure and inspector service.
"Your update today broke my app. I can t select  Manage Order  anymore and that s an incredibly important feature.

And browse history doesn t work anymore either"
I use this app for a month when you see things that they are cheap you think it s the best but when you order something they will not send you all of the seller are scam the ask for your phone number and the stool your money please don t use this app all of sellers are scam.
Doing business under the Alibaba platform is very reliable and a great way to shop in China.
As a business person and not knowing the quality of your product as of yet I will order no more than 1 to 10 items At any given time until I know what I m purchasing thank you!
I m just thinking about shopping here. It s my first time here. So far I m impressed with this site.
I don t see the price it s so many information not so clear!
OK I m so excited your work is beautiful thank you
"Choose more than one supplier and always get samples. Always choose final supplier on product , service and price."
"The color and finish of the product are much better than the product photos.
I tested it after using it all day, and the sound quality is very good and it is a great product."
The quality and detail they took in creating my product!
The Goods Arrive onTime
I definitely would enjoy getting some estrogen and buying some stock to
"my expierience was great,I will use again this platform"
Great work really appreciate
Waste of product's
"You add something you like because it was super cheap. Then, you calculate the shipping and find out your $20 item will cost $1,000 to ship. I mean, what type of **** is that? I can t believe this service is still running and I wouldn t recommend this service to anyone."
"The service is very complete and professional, it met the estimated delivery time.
The staff took the time to explain the entire procedure that is going to be carried out and they give you a concrete answer to any doubt that may arise and they give you advice to minimize risks and reduce unnecessary costs.
Effective and professional service."
I honestly can t believe this exists Alibaba is SO helpful
This company has always been a great source for my business. Will def use again for my business needs. Great job!
I am able to find awesome products at great prices.
Because of Covid my business tanked and needed a refund on an order that hadn t shipped. I m still waiting on a refund that was agreed between buyer and seller but Alibaba can t seem to figure out how to refund. It s been 49 days. I can t close down my business without having all accounts closed so I m paying fees until they figure it out.
"Fast production and shipping, great quality"
"This is a great way to meet outstanding companies, that will help our US clients."
Good place to shop for business
"No matter the time of day, the seller answers your questions and concerns very soon. That makes him reliable for the customer."
We love build for houses and businesses too faster living modern environment.
I love it  
"Thx.  for amazing people working honestly and perfectly to get the clients relax and get their purchases on time and more important is the way they double confirm at every order to make sure that mistakes in material selection or specifications .
Alibaba is a   Brand for Excellency. "
"Everything went perfectly and easily. Communication with the supplier, the delivery, and the product. I'm happy."
"Great app! Allows to manage your biz from anywhere in the world! Thank you, great tool!"
Very good in wholesale service.. easy to get sullier
"I collect dolls and I love the ones on this shop, but My question is, is can you buy singular items? There are just a few things that I want for myself, thanks:)"
Amazing I m really just starting out so
"Trade insurance doesn t work at all they just based on the suppliers 
Jane who work for alibaba totally into suppliers I place a big order in feb 2019 and not get anything till today(April 10th 2019) 
And apply for refund in March 2019 he is keep bouncing my time because he loves suppliers"
SO much more intuitive than using Alibaba on my computer! Wild
"Most of the sellers are sneaky and try to mislead you with pricing and the app won t allow you to submit complaints, etc. even though it pops up with the the form there s no submit button. So this is an app issue and needs to be resolved."
Website is easy to navigate. Prices are great too!
"Hi,when I one order I don 't know where I can choose the size I want"
I m new to this site I love it already
Anything you want would be cheaper here then anywhere
The items were very nice and arrived in great condition. They were all beautiful.
Very effectiveness and easy to get products
Hard to speak to manufacturers via chat as it s constantly loading. Please fix this issue
Stephen is hardworking and has great ideas. Very pleased with his work and commitment. Look forward to working with him on many products/projects.
I just got started and wanted to sample some goat meat
"This supplier is good and trusted.
Has patient and professional sales team for my house project. Will consider client and give good suggestion.
Very happy to buy from them."
I don tKnow what took me so long to find this app but oh my God I m thankful I did a little difficult at first to figure out but now that I m getting the hang of easy to browse very user-friendly just an overall great app thank you so much to the developers
Wonderful more than easy
"Very happy with the communication when doing business and reaching an agreement, it arrived on time and with good quality."
A pleasure to do business with them. Very attentive. Quick responses. Merchandise is correct and works perfectly. Fast shipping.
"I purchase in March 3glass dildo,and i only got 1 ???i pay with my credit card i can provide a copy of the payment that you have recently got from me"
I was very happy with the service and delivery. i would order from them again anytime.
Great app! Highly recommend!
"I typically love Alibaba but recently I've had trouble trying to make purchases because reviews are no longer available on the app. Am I the only person this is happening to? I will never blindly trust a supplier with no customer reviews, sorry."
"My order is late and clearly I haven t received the items, yet alibaba automatically completed the status of my order. Now I don t know if I ll ever get my items. How is it automatically completed if I still didn t get the items I purchased?"
Alibaba has a great communication and an amazing community and network I always enjoy the vendors of Alibaba as they take great care in mitigating issues that may arise in this platform as we all understand we are all human and respect is earned .no matter how little the issue is Alibaba will always follow through till corrected  
"Fast respose, fast dellivery, great products."
"So far, this has been a high-quality product! Easy to use and excellent customer service!"
"Good Ali baba
I like this store and company I have complaining for items I need to buy this pls help me how buy online 
Thanks"
"I am not sure if this is right, because I have made inquiries in the past and no response. Please let me know if this right business site to buy used cars. Fatasaaba"
"Excellent Products AAA+ refurbishing phone machines.

AAA customer service if you have any problems they will video chat with you via Skype they will explain everything step-by-step again awesome service."
"I ve worked with sellers on Alibaba for many years and have spent A LOT to have really amazing things built at affordable prices.  Most of them are great, however some are not and it seems Alibaba is unwilling to offer buyer protection as they have described. We recently ordered a very expensive electric vehicle for our business that was over $10K. Everything was great until US customs miscategoriezed it and it was rejected.  We tried everything possible to fix this issue but unfortunately it had to be shipped back.  We paid for the return shipping. Now the manufacture is unwilling to provide us with a refund and we LOST the trade assurance dispute with Alibaba. This is ridiculous."
"Useless app in Windows Chrome, Windows Explorer, and iPad. Unable to delete old mesages, RFQ, and orders. App crashes when trying to delete on ipad, with latest upgrades. Hard to know, which messages are old and new sometimes."
Every time I attempted to buy a product the seller tried to pull me offsite to make purchase arrangements. You should ban people  like this from your forum or at least divide your business through your app as certified with assurance or non certified without assurance.
I Like the site you very much very good products thank you
Fast. Great way to contact manufacturers in other countries. Bravo.
Vendors are amazing they are patient and help you with what you need
"Alibaba needs more shipping options to the U.S. I researched purchasing an electric ATV (quad/four wheeler) for 5 weeks on Alibaba. I looked at 10 different companies. At first I was about to give up completely because none of the companies seemed to understand English well enough to understand my product requirements and what I was looking for. Almost every company told me I could buy the ATV from them and they would ship it to the nearest U.S. seaport, but I would have to figure out how to get it from there, through Customs, and to my home in Utah myself. Most of the companies had no option available to them to do the logistics themselves or to have a 3rd party company do it for them. I finally found 1 of 10 companies that could sell me the ATV, clear customs, and provide ground shipping, but it added 100% to the cost of the product. Alibaba has some great product options, but Please improve the shipping options available so you can increase your sales to the United States. Thanks."
Very nice    
"I am very satisfied with Hi-Flying. Very proffesionele processing, very friendly communication, very fast delivery and a good product."
"Not very intuitive, complicated business model, confusing replies. I have made multiple orders and haven t received anything yet....but I m hopeful"
"M
Thank"
Using this app since 2016 there no problem until now.
Easy to use love the layout
"I have nothing to say.
Just Perfect !"
Excellent for store front
I like your web site has a lot of interesting products.
"I order 2 times from alibaba to middle east region. I think that aliexpress is much better than alibaba since you can know total amount you will be paying for a product and you can sort products from low to high. But alibaba you will be facing additional costs such as air shipping ( high cost), customs, and clearance in your country. So this leads to higher product cost price. For example i bought 20 scarfs on alibaba each costs 3.1$ when shipped and customs clearance it increased to 7$ while the same item is found on aliexpress for 6.5$. This app should be more improved in this area."
"I love this because it s good for business. 
Cheaper items"
"Excelent service, client support and fast delivery"
"The experience using the platform was great because everything was clear and straightforward since the beginning. The products I ordered were delivered on time according to schedule, and they matched the pictures shown on the website perfectly. The communication was easy, fluent, and professional at all times."
I ordered a scooter from alibaba for an unreal price and knew it was a scam but ordered anyway..and sure enough you kept my money and had to contact PayPal to get it back..hope the readers know what scammers you are...must be the way you make money these days.....ripping off the working man..
So glad to work with a company like this
I bought a product from a seller in Chan and the seller lied about being registered with the EPA. the seller committed fraud and alibaba trade assurance won t do anything for me because they can barely understand my English dispute. Terrible app and company.
good service thanks....
"Experiencing many problems in chats loading, tag management, profile logins and so on."
"I love this app! I found exactly what I was looking for, communicated really well with the seller and received my order much sooner than I expected! 

I recommend using Alibaba!"
"I am impressed with Ali all the way around. They are very pleasant to work with and fulfill and complete your requested services. They are thorough and want to make sure the customer is completely satisfied with their orders. They get back with you when you ask questions if they have to do a little research first, and that shows they care about the order being placed correctly, which shows the customer they are a company they will want to work with in the future, especially if you are dealing with merchandise that has to be delivered far away around the world!"
"Had to log in 3 different times during the process of ordering a part.  Then it told me abnormal conditions-log in with computer.  Tried again, it worked but still difficult"
"I use this app all the time and have never had any problems with it until recently. First off, my browsing history hasn t updated since the beginning of august. This is very frustrating as I cannot go back and look at previous products. This can make it hard to find the products again that I may be interested in. Second, every product under the details tab is showing a product that doesn t even relate to the product itself. Every listing I look at shows outdoor furniture. Please fix these bugs ASAP and the app is a 5/5."
"I believe it was an accident to exchange the product. But for sure, because it is a reputable company, the product will be exchanged."
I love your company and would like for you to do some major business with the African American business community we love the people of CHINA. Let s talk I want to buy a tuk tuk.
"Refund application is rigged, the favor is always on the supplier side you can never get a full refund without a fight between you and the supplier even though they are in the wrong. There is a lot of scammers and false advertising."
Everything was very well explained and the process of purchasing an expensive piece of equipment was smooth and trouble-free.
Easy to use. Great platform to connect with China Vendors
I would appreciate if there were an option to not receive promotional mail.
I love  you
well nice to have busines with this supplier
I love  this  site! Will ha e to figure something out and search the companies first before I search my products in fields of interests. I will say this is alibaba does not look at there own pages ????? Come on anyone s ees a Roland set selling Roland Td 30 Roland td 50.  For 500-$1.000. When a bass drums 22 inch new Roland 2021kt sells for $1.200
I love this App they literally have everything you can think of.... Best App ever !!
Easy so far
Alibaba and there Chinese manufacturers are scammers and alibaba will not protect its customers only their manufacture. I brought a food truck and when I received the food truck the manufacturer blackmailed me for more money ($900) so I could receive the manufacture statement of origin which I need to register it for my title it has been more then 6 months and alibaba hasn t done anything to punish them for there fraudulent behavior. Just buy American don t spend your money with those scammer
This app is so good
I received packages on time no damage nothing broken Will be ordering again
"It looked complicated at first, but once you get in touch, everyone is very helpful and it's a lot of fun!"
Can t purchase anything yet every merchant asks one thing: can you provide your address please?
Can t really review until I try the product
"Aside from a couple of minor details that were quickly rectified it was a pleasure to deal with this company. Communication was good and quick and the whole transaction went smoothly, culminating in a prompt delivery"
"MUST ACCEPT THAT YOU HAVE ZERO PROTECTION
We ordered a product that was customized and made 30% initial payment around $9k. Supplier admitted after 30-40 days (weeks after the expected ship time) they are unable to make what we needed. We asked refund no response.

Checkout completed on Alibaba and we followed the direction on their website. Paid the exact amount. I have the proof of payment and they also confirmed the payment. Everything is on the chat history for Alibaba to confirm. I don't think there could be any case that would be more clear and easier to refund than this.

Alibaba says we need to ask refund from supplier which is not refunding.

If Alibaba is not helping with this scenario where you pay as instructed and supplier admits they won't do it, not sure what is the point of placing an order on Alibaba.

That being said, you have no protection at all with Alibaba. You can use any Chinese website or work directly with suppliers and you will have the same protection."
"Michelle went out of her way to help me and to make sure that the end product was perfect! and it was perfect! No challenge was too difficult for her and her team. It turned out beautifully and all my company business associates agree! Thank you so very much! We will for sure be ordering more!

Great company!

"Due of Iran Sanction the only available shipment is DHL which the price rate is real expensive 
You should contribute with more shipment companies in each country to reduce the customer fees
Otherwise the item price and other qualities are good enough
I purchase as a customer from UAE which am currently residing in Iran and that double prices my fee"
easy to find and by the product
"Great people, understandable and quick response"
"The messaging capabilities could use some work, but it s otherwise a good app."
Top seller on Alibaba IMO. Been dealing with this company for over 3 years now and always happy with orders and Julie's professional approach. Will remain a repeat customer for many years to come.
"I like the site; I just wish I would ve know that if you choose  chat now , you have to include the picture of the product otherwise they don t know which product you re talking about"
Messages transmitted on the app don t show up on the desktop account.
It s such a joy to deal with the supplier . Always fair and true . Never a problem. Love this app.
"Changing your password in the app is impossible. It instructed me to use letters, numbers and symbols in the password, but when I do, it does not accept it.
Chatting with customer service is frustrating as they post preset questions. Still not sure if it s a real person or an automated system."
I ve ordered from a company off this site and the company refuses to return my money for a order that they sent to a wrong address so I don t have my money or the product I ordered and it s been a long time and no one is willing to help they just are keeping my money I call that fraud
Shipping options are extremely expensive and takes right much time... fastest I seen a supplier get me my order in the United States was two weeks. That was the fastest.... slowest took right at 3 months... need more /cheaper options for shipping
"Since actual customer service is obsolete, this app needs viable options. For example, how can a buyer  cancel a refund request ?  Make the app more user friendly. It should not be frustrating to use. Trade Assurance has an explanation, but not user friendly, not tech savvy."
Great site. Many Quick Reponses. Sometimes too quick but that a great problem to have.
There quality is very bad and they imitating everything nothing real like pictures on their website
seller is extremely responsive to request
"If you love being sold low grade faulty items, and having them side with the seller over any dispute even though you ve been blatantly scammed then Alibaba is the place for you  "
Just started asked for a review here you go . Time is money .
"Professional, quick delivery and insured - very happy overall."
"I use to use Alibaba when I lived in the states, but now that I live in Thailand, I prefer Lazada."
"I have purchased from Alibaba many times however recently one of the sellers that I was dealing with sent my package by sea when I asked and paid for it to be sent by airplane! Now the Alibaba dispute agent is siding with the seller and refusing to refund my money! They ve been holding my money for weeks and this should have. Only been a 2 week process! My biggest issue is that when I ask for a manager, supervisor or superior I m always told that there isn t one. They say that you re covered by trade assurance but really it s all up I the dispute agent that you get and it ends with them. There s no going further! As soon as my dispute is over I m deleting alibaba and telling everyone who will listen about how unprofessional and unfair they are! If possible, find sellers on Alibaba and deal with them off of the Alibaba platform!  It makes no sense to pay the extra fees because if anything happens they won t have your back anyway!"
I am happy with everything. thank you.
Easier than other similar apps.
Easy to use app. The help provided is awesome super easy to find products highly recommend
The supplier was so gently and quickly responding what was I looked for.
i like to buy because you find what you ask for
Boycott china trash govt
Alibaba has a great app easy to use and browse products. Very helpful. Thanks!
great company to deal with

"Reached out to this manufacturer for T shirts to be used in a small business - I was pleasantly surprised by the high quality. Shirts were exactly how they are advertised on their webpage, edge graded and with the vintage look. I will be ordering from them again. Thank you to Alec and the team!"

All Received We are terribly disappointed! We opened up a dispute to alibaba.com to refund my money and to return the JUNK Machine but the sales person, tried to avoid the concerned. She just offered alternative wrapper to use. Don't buy this kind of JUNK or else, you just took a rock to hit your head. They didn't understand that the money used to pay on it was invested on lots of blood work just to help you get into success. Unfortunately, it didn't help!

Aside from late received and damaged on the hopper, the machine didn't work as per told on sales strategies.

You made money but you cheated !"
Communication is great and shipping is fast
Nice platform
Loving this app and it s diverse products
I would like to be able to refine the search by low to high price and I would also like to see the shipping fee on the order without having to email the seller
Purchased a unit that obviously says it for 11-17 Camry. Purchased spoke to the manufacturer. No manual. No tech support. No way of understand what I m clearly explaining. No accountability for false advertising. Stay away if you trying to get quality
"The only thing that was difficult was that Toll delivered the parcel and I did not receive any notification on wether if not home that I could notify to leave in a safe place at my home.
I had to organise someone to go and collect at a drop off near me which was a hassle and took some organising. DHL is much better and gives you the option"
I get many offers from the merchants. Why is the pricing they have in the ads never even close to the quotes I receive when I am interested in an item? Seems bait and switch!
"Goods arrived before the timeline although I received late because the courier company that used the supply was very patient and always touch-base to inform tracking and always very polite in answering.

I recommend."
Thank you Alibaba Keep up the great work.
I m Trying To Log In Thru My Computer And It Won t Let Me!!!!
I just got an i12 promax very unsatisfy very bad quality
Provided all the information. They answered quickly. Quickly sent.
Pls fix it. Try to uninstall also cannot.
"I have been around or in business my entire life and deal with wholesale all the time. I also purchase almost daily through numerous platforms. Signed up for a first time account and was immediately suspended. Alibaba platform wouldn't work on my everyday computer so I tried another one in the same office which didn't work either. Apparently this triggered an automatic suspension for suspicious activity. Took me several hours with customer service bots, that claimed they were human, to get reinstated. Then reached out to a supplier(don't know if they were an actual manufacturer or distributor because Alibaba doesn't do a good job of differentiating) for clarification on their shipping charges. They included a hefty shipping charge with no explanation what it was for. After doing research it appears I need to pay for additional expensive shipping, a freight forwarder and a customs broker in order to purchase cheap chinese junk from a chinese manufacturer that won't even respond to my questions. I still have no idea if the numerous messages I sent were actually sent or read because I can't find any messages sent or received through my account. I must be missing something. How does anybody use this platform to purchase anything? In addition, after paying all the middle people either marking up or taking a direct payment from me, how does anybody save money or make a profit? What is the point of working directly with a manufacturer if multiple people, businesses or governments still take a cut in order to receive your products? It appears to be an expensive, complicated and time consuming process. You might as well pay a little more retail and skip all the BS and save lots of time. Time is money and I wasted a lot of time. Closed account and moved on. Alibaba is a bad joke."
Great app to review the products in the Chinese market.
Was very easy buy and get information about the product and shipment
Good and fantastic
"It would be nice to see some of the advertising on Alibaba to reflect the correct price for the photographs they are showing it becomes extremely ambiguous on how much that product is then freight charges I see the freight charges for 16 batteries ranging from 300 dollars to over the price of the 16 batteries, around 1800 dollars 
Then to top it off I cannot find or speak to anybody with Alibaba there guarantees I cannot find anything definitive"
It is the very good online business
I love alibaba the vendors are very professional that I ve had the pleasure to do business with.
It's a very trusty service and good service very fast too
I am a first time visitor to this site. I am very surprised to see so many items.
No unpleasant surprises. Very smooth transaction.
easy to find relevant products. good price competition. reliable and timely delivery.
Jackie Li made my buying experience smooth and professional.
"My order was shipped to my previous address in California.   I have my current and new address on file with my order.  No one is responding to this.  DHL says contact the merchant. Merchant is not responding to any of my mails. Ceremony is less than two weeks and I am lost as to what to do.  Someone help me solve this. 
Frustrated customer

"I like alibaba. I don't always like the vendors, but the website and ease of access to these vendors is nice."
The customer service is great. Alibaba is an excellent place to find suppliers. The problems I have with this app is pretty much is only notifications.   when I get a message from the supplier I only get a notification sometimes instead of every time I get a message from the supplier.
I m on an iPhone and every time I go to put in my information for payment it doesn t let me. And the website is down and who knows if it ll work there either. Maybe it is just my phone but it is def not me misunderstanding or anything. I ve tried over and over and the same thing happens
"Its a one stop centre for supplier. What else do you need, all inside here. So far so good."
User friendly and absolutely helpful. Even my grandad can buy stuff from this apps!
i like it

Great inventory of different modell and sizes.
"The best company in the world, they are the best, I love them"
Great if you're trying to buy wholesale for you business!
the goods arrived very quickly. Corresponds to the description. High quality.
Ok so I tried to buy many things with different suppliers and my card never went through I TRIED 5 DIFFERENT CARD and not one went through and yes I verified all 5 card and none went through I don t recommend this app unless you want to waste your time like me.
I have had issues before with this company but spoke with them about the issues and with this order they have corrected them all. Fast shipping accurate schedules and helpful sales assistance.
"Fast and great quality products, sales person is amazing."
"Excellent quality in their products and very professional to deal with. The canvas looks great, the process was easy, and delivered on time. I would recommend this seller to everyone."
"The website is great for seeing all the products that is available for the price.

It s great to have the best products listed in your website."
Good so far
"It a app from china but cant save my address in chinese,only english? What?
when i gonna send to my warehouse i need to contact the seller to manually put the address for me,how annoying! Imagine need to order stock from over 10factory ,need do it one by one...reported the problem 30day ago seems like it still same today! 
Not recommend for people who wanna save their address in chinese!"
"1. So far so good, not bad at all except for one just incident which is known. The very best manufacturer for Me as regards to tablets, ls Shenzhen Carevery Technology Co. Ltd. l will recommend their tablet pc Products anytime, l am very very satisfied with their tablet pc products - After buying so Many Not very good tablet pc products.
2. l will also recommend ALIBABA anytime to anyone, because of buying products on the platform is very very *SAFE WITH TRADE ASSURANCE
3. And furthermore, also because of how issues are *Quickly *Resolved.
4. Alibaba has one of the best highest safety standards regarding to buying and selling, like ALIEXPRESS - EBAY etc. where also, i am a member and has been buying for years."
"This was the first time I decided to take a risk and order from Alibaba after years of seeing it advertised. It also helped to see that they take an active approach, if someone is not satisfied with the quality of their service or order."
"The website is very confused, not friendly and it took me quite ling time to understand how It worked.
I never will use this platform again. I had to pay huge taxation to get the good cleared from custom. UPS charged me the same value than the original price. So I paid double without any advice or short notice.
So, horrible experience and you will not see my face here again."
"Great site, easy to navigate and understand."
"Great communication, great products and fast shipping."
it is easy to you use the major difficulty's I have is the time zone but that's normal. the other one is the suppliers will hound you how ever they can i.e. FB Instagram and wats app even msging business or sporting clubs FB pages. other then that the guys that just use alibaba are amazing
"Quality supplier, accurate description of product,
speedy delivery, very well packaged.
RECOMMENDED BY ME"
Quick response and quality products. Be very specific in your inquiries.
"Excelent seller, very Kind and helpfull"
Unable to found product correctly.
"Since the adoption and enforcement of basically having to have the app, I have found the entire experience slow and difficult.

It is not fun to utilize Alibaba - and it is not better for business.

It is a very good example of a company that has tons of money but no understanding of what made it grow so quickly. It is one of the worst apps I have ever used from a well funded company."
"No Chinese language,
No Malaysia ringgit converter."
Extremely quick shipping and the product was just as expected.
Want to order so much from here but no shipping options.
Not having to check on the progress of the order.
"Great communication and the right part with the right information
Best so far in Alibaba service."
I message day in and day out about products I want to buy and have shipped to me in bulk pieces of 1000 or more which is the MOQ but I never get responses. Some just read your messages and don t reply at all. I ll find US based suppliers instead.
This is my first purchase. you can find helpful suppliers with very good and competitive price in Alibaba.
"This is probably the worst way to make any purchase... i ordered 3 different things with 3 different companies and they all came back to me 2 days later saying that customs is asking for stamps and money to pay customs if not my shipment won t be released, that is a scam i tried one and i sent the payment just to see and the Shipment never came and they don t answer your phone calls or text messages PLEASE IM TELLING YOU DONT BUY ANYTHING FROM HERE IF YOU DO PLEASE DO YOUR RESEARCH CAUSE ABOUT 90 percent is a SCAM !!!"
Great site we love it it s been pleasure to use it
"Just about any product you want is gonna come to you cheaply made, disappointing and a waste of money. Most people who use this app don t trust the product enough to use it themselves and that is a reflections on the type of scum that are involved in ripping people off with scam like business like these."
Its a great website for sourcing any product. My company website: zymak.com.bd
"My contact at the company (Engs Tee) was extremely helpful and worked hard to achieve a great shipping and product price for me.
The product is exactly what I asked for and works well."
I like the app it really depends on who your vendor is. I ve had nothing but pleasant encounters with my vendors. I make sure I do my research before shopping with anyone new & I use my PayPal rather than my direct credit card.
We are always looking for the best value for our clients. This manufacturer gave us a great price plus included extra features like two sided printing and reinforced stitched handles at no additional cost; (compared to the other manufactures). The printing and stitching quality was done exceptionally well.
"As long as you are wise with who you purchase from you ll always be good. It is not the apps fault if you choose a bad vendor!   This app is amazing & never let me down, vendors are always 10/10.  "
User friendly easy to find what you re looking for.
Easy to use which allows for faster service to take care of business!
Alibaba looks great and has a lot to offer the user just enough for you to search for your own feedback in the system and leave you wonder if what you have found was placed there for you rather than being brought to your fingertips by design
"So I downloaded the app because the messaging system was confusing to me on the actual website. The app is wayyy more user friendly plus I can make deals on the go!!!! Perfect,and I love how quick the suppliers reply!"
"Great communication and very easy to use the web site.
Nice website"
"I paid USD$300 and ordered 2 wigs from Xuchang Fuxin Hair Products Co.,Ltd. on alibaba on 16-02-2023 and recieve two extremely poor quality wigs that did not feel like hair atall. I contacted both the supplier and alibaba but none was helpful in getting me a refund or send the correct hair i ordered. A complete waste of money"
"I'm able to search quality products from home and get beat price comparison from several
Manufacturers while lying relaxing on my bed"

Their things are cheap and with a delivery
Good App and Special Download
"ALIBABA ITS COMPLETELY A SCAM!!!
HOW COME ?
THEY WROTE A CHEAPER PRICE ON ALL THE ITEMS AND WHEN U CHAT WITH THEM THE PRICE INCREASE FROM 10  to 400  ?
AND U VE TO PAY SHIPPINGS TOO!
THTA s MAD!
REMEMBER ALL EUROPE IS STILL BUYING FROM CHINA CUS OF CHEAPER PRICE , IF U INCREASE LIKE THAT WILL COME ONLY THE CHINESE TO BUY AT CHEAPER PRICE ( how will be)"
"I can t use the app , it used to be good , now the emails doesn t upload and I can write back .. so my business is stop"
Very nice platform for business I like it
Great company with phantastic products. Highly recommended!
"vraiment faire attention aucune protection chez Alibaba. j'ai fait deux commande identique et une arrive a moiti . donc facile a v rifier car le poids change du premier colis au deuxi me. mais Alibaba me la mis dans la BABA. a fuir.

really be careful no protection at alibaba. I made two identical orders and one arrived halfway. therefore easy to check because the weight changes from the first package to the second. but Alibaba put it in BABA for me. to flee."
Always very helpful and great access to products with great prices
Nich app
"it was great service all the way especially the after service which is the most important for me. the product is total good quality, beautiful and head turner, easy to drive and very useful to carry cargo"
For months I ve been trying to get a drain and overflow set for bathtubs in the United States and I get all kinds of offers but I don t get the offer for the right product. How can I make this work because I think I m just wasting my time in Alibaba
"I ordered items and seen that it shipped. That was great at the time. Three weeks later I see that the tracking said that the items was delivered. Yes, they were delivered but not to me or the state that I live in. I contacted the supplier and they claimed that was an error tracking number and sends me a copy of a UPS label that they just created. That means my items never shipped out. I put in a claim with the trade assurance letting them know my items never shipped and the tracking number in my order has nothing to do with my order. I let them know that it needed to be updated to not delivered/ complete so my trade assurance can start on the day the items are actually delivered. To make a long story short they never updated the order and kept saying the supplier made an error with shipping and has fixed it. You will receive your items soon. I tell you they need to hire people who can actually read and write English. Just an horrible experience. This is why I always do test runs with new suppliers and only place small orders for this reason. Now once my order is delivered my trade assurance will be no good because the supplier refuse to update the order because that will prove they necker shipped it out when they claimed they did. This was my experience and it was not a good one."
We are very happy with the products AND with the professional service! We honestly recommend Mr.Skull to any potential buyer.
"Rose Wu is amazing!!! I love working with her. My products are always quality and they arrive on time!!!!! I absolutely love this vendor 
I love my waist trainers. I love my logo!!!! Thank you so much Rose Wu!!!!"
I already have alibaba app And I come from Malta
Server always has issues. Page does not connect
My experience was great because when I outlined what we wanted they replied promptly with exactly what they could supply. We agreed and then the product was sent. Upon seeing it our team were so pleased!!! We are very grateful indeed!!!
"Fast response, fast delivery"
Cant open the app after update the latest version!
"Great sales support by Aaron, including extra technical details, offering of complementary accesories and tracking from initial order, payment, delivery, customs processing, reception and invoicing. The product itself was received fast and it is of good quality and according to specifications."
Easy to navigate app
"Before I trusted Alibaba, I ordered from a vendor directly off their website and honestly, I had a better experience and got better prices with Alibaba than dealing directly with that provider outside of this platform. The vendor I found on Alibaba is excellent to work with. Faster shipping and great customer service."
It make things easy for me to buy world wide
"Wonderful Houseware Industry Co., Ltd. is best for wood supplies"
There needs to be more more manufacturers from around the globe. Like Italy and etc. but it s good. Also they shouldn t ban someone s account if they sent multiple inquiries..
In new marketing business and using Alibaba for potential suppliers of goods and services. Awesome results and suppliers do far very responsive.
It s a productive place to buy things. It s just not for me. Thank you.
This is one of the best apps to use if you're in business or looking to start a business and want to find dealers or supplies to help you sale online or in your one store.
"Many suppliers to do business with. Also, quality products at reasonable prices."
Cannot log in for several days even though right credentials
Very good to buy anything
Honestly as a seller I am very pleased. You can find almost anything here. It s amazing totally recommend.
Sometimes I don t want to order goods here even though I saw so many things I like but am scared of scam. If you can make it possible to make payment on delivery it will be better
"I like the RFQ, the people are great to work with. very helpfull for small prototyping and good quoting for mass orders!"
"They sand you many emails daily.
This is really frustrating.
I couldn't figure it out yet how to stop it.
Feels like a invasion!!!
Wish id never looked for anything on this junksite!!!"
I found what i need
I have been on here for a month now and have contacted hundreds of people. I have been ripped off and haven t found one legit seller. This is nothing but a ripoff.
So far so great.
the product has delivered with good condition and the specification of product are meet our expectation.
So good
"I will recommended strongly this company
They understand so quickly what I needed and respond so fast
fast design, fast shipping, perfect product and the best service..."
Good apps
I just wanted to know how to buy and ship goods from china to Uganda
"Prices are listed weird and don t have set shipping methods, also I tried an order out and my product never arrived."
Good plattform to do business. On Time

Spontaneous
"I ve been scammed on this platform , terrible service from Alibaba they did not help AT ALL!!! Unfortunately it was a very regretting decision to trust this App If I could give ZERO stars I would."
Hi I like to buy your product and test drive it
PayPal does not work as payment method. Very inconvenient. But this is an incredible opportunity for small business to expand product for consumers
"So far no problems scrolling, adding stuff to cart was easy and signing in was also successful."
"great people, easy, simple"
"I had a problem with my previous supplier and Ms. Lv of DOYA Optic went out of their way to listen to my problem, provide a product not normally sold separately, and helped me greatly with an incredible product that worked flawlessly. Thank you DOYA, and thank you Ms. LV!"
"Alibaba is amazing, easily find very hard to get parts at exceptional value. Alibaba makes it very easy to outsource contracts threw many amazing producers."
Service is very professional
"Shipping cost overvalued, if you want do a store, you will need a lot of money, Alibaba could improve their own payment agreements with Efecty Co, this way improve could open a big importation and money for China without use Us dollars how reference... EFECTY,This company also has transportation and shipping agreements that could open a large labor camp for all because This company can reach any corner of the country. Thanks and I am waiting for..."
"The app constantly freezes or buffer for a prolong period of time, mainly when choosing the shipping method. I have yet to complete an order because of this issue."
"They let you make your first purchase and then they block debit transactions with the interest that you send them a photo of your credit targets, personal identification and a bill with name and address, all this for what. ???  In order to steal your money and your identity, beware of Alibaba, with the only app that does this theft"
This company is full of fraudsters that are waiting to take your money and send you something completely different. Avoid at all costs and never deal with them for any item above $100.
No response from seller.
This company is excellent to deal business with.
"They wont help you with a return. 
They claim money back guarantee only to lure you to buy. Most suppliers are there to take advantage of  you so be-careful. 
I dont recommend this application alibaba there are better optima like cj dropshippers."
"Picked a winner, I paid for a product and delivery and was told it wasn t coming. Shipping was added after purchase but no attempt at delivery was made. The seller has removed the item from the website but similar products exist for comparable prices... can t just buy another one cause I wasn t stable enough to endure the financial shock of this robbery. Wish Trade assurance meant something."
"Not understanding how others are having such a great experience this app. The UI is very disappointing considering size of business. Highly unreliable login & over interface struggles. Don t recommend app, use on computer for best experience."
"This App is a great business opportunity!
Enjoying it 100%. Excellent everything !"
I love the fact That I can buy everything I want and message everyone individual at one time !!!!
helpful agent ...
"All the items are super cheap, but from China, so that means long shipping times and difficult communications."
"Just downloaded, already ask me rate it hmmm"
I find it difficult to see what I was searching for because they keep showing stuff I don t need. It s a bit disappointing.
I love the quality of the stuff and the pricing is accurate and affordable
"Great communication, service and products. Made multiple purchases and will continue doing business with them!"
"I'm satisfied, the product I ordered was of good quality. Karla Liu was helpful throughout the process.
The issue I had was from the shipping company, but overall it was a great expirience.
I recommend them."
Very Nice Affordable Clothing & Other Accessories!! I Highly Recommend All Businesses To Shop Here!! You Will Not Be Disappointed!! 
"Buying on Alibaba can involve problems. Alibaba can't control the quality or accuracy of the good being shipped or the integrity of the sellers You will get wrong items, poor quality, wrong colors and very late and slow service. Done is good and bad faith. But Alibaba will help to get a favorable resolution to any disputes."
"The package was stuck in the customs for more than 3 weeks due to the false information given by the buyer. It has been a very difficult transition and package has been delayed for more than 3 weeks, which affects business"
The perfect place to purchase bulk. They ship express every time and you have your product in no time.
It can be a bit confusing I suggest using the search bar.
"I recently had the opportunity to explore Alibaba as a platform for sourcing suppliers from China, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations in every way. Alibaba has truly established itself as the go-to platform for businesses looking to connect with suppliers and secure the best prices in the market. Here's why I believe Alibaba is the best platform for this purpose.

Vast Supplier Network: Alibaba boasts an extensive network of suppliers, encompassing a wide range of industries and products. Whether you're looking for electronics, clothing, machinery, or any other type of product, you'll find countless suppliers on Alibaba willing to cater to your needs. The platform's vast supplier database ensures that you can explore multiple options and choose the one that best suits your requirements.

Competitive Pricing: One of the biggest advantages of Alibaba is the ability to find suppliers offering the best prices in the market. The platform facilitates direct communication with suppliers, allowing you to negotiate and strike the most competitive deals. This price advantage is particularly beneficial for businesses looking to maximize their profit margins or those operating on a tight budget.

Trade Assurance: Alibaba's Trade Assurance feature is a game-changer when it comes to ensuring a secure and trustworthy transaction. With Trade Assurance, buyers are protected against supplier fraud or misrepresentation. The feature provides a safety net by offering full or partial refunds if the products received do not meet the agreed-upon specifications or if the shipment is delayed. This level of assurance adds peace of mind and significantly reduces the risks associated with international trade.

Supplier Verification: Alibaba takes supplier verification seriously, which is crucial when dealing with overseas suppliers. The platform offers various verification badges and certifications that indicate a supplier's reliability, such as Gold Supplier, Onsite Check, and Assessed Supplier. These verification measures help in building trust and confidence in the suppliers you choose to work with.

Communication Tools: Alibaba provides an array of communication tools that simplify the process of contacting and collaborating with suppliers. The platform's messaging system allows for seamless communication, enabling you to discuss product details, negotiate prices, and address any concerns directly with the suppliers. This streamlined communication process saves time and eliminates potential misunderstandings.

In conclusion, Alibaba is undoubtedly the best platform for connecting with suppliers from China and securing the best prices in the market. Its vast supplier network, competitive pricing, and robust Trade Assurance feature make it an ideal choice for businesses of all sizes. The platform's emphasis on supplier verification and efficient communication tools further enhance the overall experience. Whether you're a small business owner or a large corporation, Alibaba provides the resources and security needed to establish fruitful relationships with Chinese suppliers. I highly recommend Alibaba for anyone looking to source products from China."
June Li seller is worst seller  and Alibaba app I bought a dish  camera On behalf of June Li The camera doesn t work I was sending missing to her she was making excuses now it is over 30 days I cannot get a refund from Ali Bubba are the apps because it is more than 30 days so I blame her to keep me and hold in Making excuses for me I am on leave I can not help you when I get to doing work Monday i will do something but she never help me so I mean she is the worst seller on this app and the whole world
"Good support and service, product delivery as expected, a reliable supplier to do business with."
The freight took long but the process kept track of the package & was helpful to anticipate the delivery of the package.
This was the first time I was making a big order through Alibaba so I was a bit nervous. However the service and the product was excellent - Thank You
"We are very happy with the delivery, good product and very fast delivery. Special thanks to Mrs Coco Dong who served us very professionally."
So most people know ramadan is a Muslim holiday well I ordered some plates that s are designed for Ramadan so I ordered and it s been up to 45 days till today and didn t get my order or anything and the seller kept say they can t do anything only if they have a ways to give this a negative star oo i would love to do that Save ur money foks
easy to find what i was looking for and quick turn around. quick check out process .
I haven t had any issues with communication from other suppliers.
This app is so bad...The prices you see are not what you get
"I online store is very user friendly and meets all user needs to identify products, see all applicable descriptions and specifications.  Ordering is easy and shipment timeframe is very reasonable."
This apps really help me find a supplier. Tq
This is my first time ordering. I am looking to see if I will like.
the best app ever
Purchased some sample of the product. Recieved it within time and the quality of the product is very good.
Vendors are constantly ripping me off sending wrong merchandise and not delivering packages at all I need refunds from 2 accounts that I haven t received I need help
All of a sudden my phone is getting notifications.  Stop!  I don t even have alibaba in my phone.
Great experience. Responsive and quality products.
"I like most of what I see each time I look ! Problem no info on cost of shipping ! 
Plus it would be nice to have someone here in Maine selling your products for you ! It would be a great plus as people that build here over charge ! Having some of you big products such as food trailers and trucks would sell great here ! Thank You ! Brad  !"
so far could be satisfactory although encountered some short falls in the preliminary stage. Always keep up with good works in order to prolong the advancement! All the best! Cheers!
I have never ordered anything from this app and after reading the reviews I don t think it would be a good idea.
"Tons of products available, I haven t ordered from anyone yet but I am looking forward to seamless transactions!"
"Pagination doesn t work. Navigation is very difficult and UN-reliable, Prices are meaningless. Freight price is unknown, products not legal in USA are not labeled as such. All sellers I ve talked to are very friendly. Descriptions mean nothing. The only proof of quality is seeing and holding the product."
It gives us easy communication between buyerand supplier. So I can get a quick feedback from suppliers.
"Difficult to obtain concise description of item including basics such as materials used in manufacturing, dimensions, weight and more. Very poor search feature. Not sure I would use again."
Everything they did was perfect. Couldn't be any better.
"I like very much the process of contacting suppliers, its easy and fast, great job."
I only need a 100 and your minimum order is 1000... can I order less.
Is fast and easy to find what you need.
Why would any company seeking to compete in the e-commerce space put out an app that is nearly completely useless.  Running on iPad Pro it is a great way to reduce screen time because you ll want to go do something else while app decides whether to load the page selected.  Terrible shame.
"Contact friendly, service perfect, delivery very fast. Perfect supplier!"
Wish I could give -5 stars do not download this app. Every time I download something this app redownloads itself on my phone. A lot of these reviews are fake.
The easiest app for me. Thanks so very much.
I am pleased with the changes in service and Qc. And the quality I see in the products  thanks to all staff and 3trh party s
All is very clear to get  and answer very fast my messages thanks
We have been buying products trough this website for almost two years. The products are for our own advertising and overall the whole service have been great.
I would not use Alibaba at all unless absolutely necessary. They have many suppliers that will steal from customers and Alibaba does Nothing to stop them.
"Ordered a product and it did not turn up by the deadline on the tracking before it is automatically confirmed as delivered, so I requested a refund and went through the process and they sided with the seller saying that it was within the normal delivery time scale, if it can take this long to turn up then why not extend the tracking period before its automatically confirmed as delivered, i have not product and am out 260 quid, I will avoid them from now on"
Awesome products even though most are from China I d rather order from them as they are one step above our technology and everything I ve owned made in China has been built to last.
"I have been getting poor customer service in this thing. I have been trying to find reliable sources to start my business and I can t get that. I have placed an order for over 2 months and I can t get information on my shipment. When I contact customer service to get a refund as they marked the shipment as delivered and it didn t, I am getting the run around from them this site just feels like a big scam"
I Am from nepal .My name is santosh sha and i think it is the most amazing app for online shoping
"Be ware,i paid 14,000$ and lost them.
I paid this money to one supplier and the supplier doesn't arrive the goods to me,i opened refund case and alibaba close the case and didnt refund me!
Saher"
This Website is kind of hard to use. I m trying to reach someone to help me. No luck.
"so ok on 1hour in app,in bgining notyet know hopply so goodas"
Very attentive to the customers orders.
The most important thing is access and expedient in finding the right seller with the right product. This site gives access to all
Very difficult to use and get through to purchase. I have tried multiple times. Platform is too difficult to purchase from.
Nice App For Buying Things 
"Alibaba has its ups and downs. they use US dollar which is annoying as between the 3 different countries, the currency exchange is forever changing and they do not alter the prices well. tracking product in transit is poor as they do not have integration to link theirs to Alibaba's tracking details, so, you have to rely on Alibaba Trade assurance if the seller doesn't send you the products. it confirms reciept saying the item has been shipped and you cannot contest it on alibaba. it only extends it. the items you see on a page are not the products they actually sell. so the image you enquire about on their page is a bit of click bait and you have to start the design phase from the very beginning. Alibaba is very behind in customer experience"
"my experience was very good and it was my first time, the representative from the company always replied very fast y replied all my questions"
"I have been trying to order a miner from the many advertised miners and prices the advertisements show and not one single vendor has been able to offer what their advertisement states. I have been given so many excuses why, yet I continue to receive emails with new crypto miners in stock and go through the whole order process time and time again and get the exact same results. It doesn t matter which vendor for I have tried over a dozen. My question to every single one of them is if they do not have the miner in stock or at the advertised price, why do you all continue to advertise that you do. False advertisement and lies. I was even given one answer stating  we are like Bitcoin, price changes daily . Wow!"
I LOVE  Ali Express. So many vendors and such great prices. I always feel confident ordering from Ali Express. I tell all my friends to get on board the Ali Express!
"Very good Interface, well organized for products details and specifications. Very helpful to select manufacture and their products."
Good
No response. Can t order the items that you want. Cannot contact anyone. Does not work.
4 months and product still not received nor my money
Can t complain so far so good
supply in time . quality very good
"I have tried this product before, my customers liked it, and i will order again"
I like the idea of having an inquiry prompt. It s hard to tell exact size on some items and I m hindered due to the fact that we don t use metric in USA.
great experience.. Coolfly was a great supplier for 2 stealth bomber e bikes.. thank you
All perfect. Like in the photos. More quickly than I expectes
"Twice I ordered things from Alibaba. Been charged and never received my order.
Also in the app wasn t able to rate seller or product. Help support unable. Most sellers don t really speak English enough to resolve orders questions"
polite helpfull service fast to replyand resolve any problems
No after sales service since 5 month we are waiting for seller assistance to use their USD6000 machine. Really sad experience

"Literally every seller I tried to buy from has taken my money. They fasle advertising pictures and videos of particular items and the sellers are using them to manipulate people for money it was 2022 aero 3s t-Rex motorcycle Without realizing it they trick you off the alibaba platform by contacting you on what s app. This is a message for any and everybody please be careful because they don t care who they hurt they make so many promises until they get your money and then they start playing games and then disappear so please be careful because it seems like alibaba platform for scammers and the so the called support team .whatever it just waste of time

I had got scammed by two different companies the first company was a company named AL SHIBA GENERAL TRADING and the second company was AUSTER ENTERPRISE LIMITED. It pretty went down the way both disputes they pretended to be good people using pics videos to manipulate they even had people pretending to be police officers contacting me demanding large amounts of money and they had the fake tracking site and everything in the form of VAT RIV etc the so called tracking site is called realglobalexpress and it had it set up to where I thought it was a legitimate website until I did my homework on them. They names are BEN FELIX and it s someone else by the name of Sheirl Denise Arrington posing as his employee she set me up so ripped off by Ben Felix now I refused to keep paying all those manipulating hidden fees and I m currently waiting for him give my refund and I literally blocked on what s app he contacted me I m not making this up because I have everything I need as evidence to back my story im just ordinary person living check to check like almost everyone else and I don t think it s right for alibaba to keep allowing this because it looks like conspiracy and I don t want to over exaggerate but literally every supplier/seller doesn t wanna do transactions the platform because they know it s nothing that alibaba can do because it doesn t leave a trail and they disable their website account so you can t file any complaints filed against them. Between the two companies I lost $2,710 from AL SHIBA GENERAL TRADING out of India and I lost $5,100 from AUSTER ENTERPRISES LIMITED out of Hong Kong"
I m happy about service because I get my desire products here. Thanks JackMa
This app is greatly
"Templates contain incorrect use of the English language and grammar errors which translates to your letter being unprofessional and you illiterate. 
Use a spell and grammar check from the web."
"It worked, was not complicated and saved me time and money."
"I just start using your site and so far so good. It s easy to find what I interested for. I hope that purchase will be easy too.
Best regards"
"It seems to good to be true. Great if a person , is opening up a store of their own.  Not too many solo items to purchase, but large MOQ
Is also good. I did manage to place a sample order."
Excellent customized product. Very good quality on product. Customer's service very helpful and reactive.
"Amazing service, once I can find a Chinese manufacturer for my bearing, I ll be in hog heaven!"
"Great service, fast shipping, good communication with the seller."
"I am very happy with my order, everything arrived very well as requested, I recommend the company, we will do more business soon, thanks Xinlong Wei for the attention"
E checking not available on the app and e checking also keeps failing after a few days. This makes it very inconvenient to pay the suppliers.
Thank you and appreciate for the biggest offers to provide all the information and knowledge to help us and save time.
A little hard to use on a tablet. Lacks size and search boxes.
"Transactions are extremely easy to complete. We have found several excellent, trustworthy, quality suppliers through Alibaba.com"
"I order a few Thousand USD products from here with different suppliers. Some products I get very good price while others are just fair with expense shipping cost. Suppliers are varied. Did not receive everything that I order yet. Will see. However I spent a lot of time to search what I need. But have encountered a lot of misleading price or product images do not match the description. They will said the price is old or not right..... waste a lot of time. But some companies are very helpful. While Some will tell you to order from other suppliers if I show them their listing price. Also agree with other reviewers, shipping cost a lot and not much choices. For giant company like this; should encourage their listing vendors to update their price. False advertising in The US are big mistakes."
I want to say Mia was such a great help and answered all of my questions. This is a great company to work with. Thank you.
"I placed an order, total with  tax  was over $380. Received notification the item wasn t available and requested I cancel order. Refund offer is $342."
Both phones I paid for were advertised as iPhones. Neither was. I got two android phones that with not hold a network. They are junk and they are refusing to refund my $130.00 never buy anything at alibaba.com

"I don t have much to say just yet, considering I just started. But so far so good."
Very trustable and always received my goods
"Very helpful , easy for me to find supplier"
Great communication although our time zone are different the company goes out and beyond to make sure my needs are met. Definitely a great company to partner with going forward. I look forward to working with you.
"Actually i ve got into this app by their ads , then when i send messages no one answers , there is many and many of fake ads this program is giving to us u must think when you download it"
It very good
Great options and customer service is impeccable look forward to doing business with them for years to come and many many more flip/remodel projects to fill with their products! Thanks
"This was fast and easy. The sight kept me updated all the way through the order, shipping and delivery process."

I ordered from here spend $463 for jars for my candles and they kept saying it s on its way but 7 months later and it still not here. I contacted the customer service and they said that it was delivered and I told them it wasn t. They didn t help me at all. So to save you time and money don t order anything from here.
